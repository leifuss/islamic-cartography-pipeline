      "text": "The two encounters led to different views on how to organize and represent the world and its parts . Maps in the tradition of Ptolemy's Geography worked with pro- jections , latitudes and longitudes , grids , occasionally scales , and the theory of astronomically defined climates , mostly seven in number . They often contain short ref- erences to uninhabitable parts of the earth due to ex- cessive cold or heat derived from Aristotelian physics and meteorology . The geographical space represented in such maps was first and foremost the entire world . It was mapped as a sphere or as a semisphere . Over time , such world maps focused more and more on the Islamic world . But certain regions of the world outside of Islamic so- cieties continued to be reported about such as China , Sri Lanka , Byzantium , or the land of the Slaves . In addition to the world maps , maps of oceans , seas , rivers , and is- lands are extant from this cartographic encounter . These local maps show clear non - Ptolemaic features . They may be the result of the mapmakers ' efforts to translate textual and oral geographic information into images . The people involved in this cartographic tradition were primarily scholars of the mathematical sciences which comprised in Islamic societies in continuation of earlier Greek models number theory , geometry , theory of proportions , and astronomy . The most important representatives of this tradition in Islamic societies were the lost maps produced in the early ninth century for the Abbasid caliph al- Ma'mun ( r . 198-218 h / 813-33 ) , the maps extant in Muḥammad b . Mūsā al - Khwārazmi's ( fl . late second - early third century h / late eighth - early ninth century ) Şurat al- ard ( image / form of the earth ) , the maps extant in copies of the new Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Geography made by Georgios Amirutzes ( d . 1475 ) and his son for the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet Fatih ( r . 849 h / 1444 and 855-86 h / 1451-81 ) , and the maps found in the geographical chapter of texts on ilm al - bay'a ( mathematical cos- mography ) such as Nizam al - Din al - Nīsābūrī's ( d . 730 h / 1329 ) Tawdiḥ or Sharb al - Tadbkira ( explanation of or commentary on the ' Memoir ' ) ( Figure 1 ) .",

      "text": "Maps derived from possible Sasanian models worked with geometrical figures such as circles , semicircles , crescents , triangles , rectangles , ovals , and straight lines to represent regional units , directions , and distances . Their focal points are the postal and pilgrimage routes within the Abbasid Empire and other Islamic states , for instance , in al - Andalus and the main parts that formed the Abbasid caliphate . The views on what these parts were and which rank each part assumed in relationship to the others depended largely on the outlook the mapmaker and commentator subscribed to a preference for Iranian cultural values , a preference for Islamic values , or a preference for his own environment and travel experi- ences . The set of maps created within this tradition in- cluded as a rule a world map and in most cases 21 regional maps . Most of the world maps in the extant manuscripts show the world as a full circle ; but there are also manuscripts from as early as the tenth century and as late as probably the seventeenth or eighteenth century that show the world as a bird . The distribution of the regions over the body of the bird varies . China or Arabia can be found as the head . India , the land of the Khazars in the Northern Caucasus Mountains , Asia , or Africa fill the wings . The tail is taken up by Northern Africa or Europe . The world maps show cosmological concepts such as al- Babr al - Mubit ( the Encompassing Sea ) also known from much earlier cultures and religious concepts specific to the Qur'an and other sources of Muslim belief such as the barzakh , a small , narrow land barrier that separates the two main oceans of the maps , that is , the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea . The main Quranic meaning of barzakh is , however , not geographical , but eschatological . It denotes the life of the soul after the death of the body until the Day of Judgment . The provinces and regions in these world maps are mostly registered in form of rectangular tables or stripes of boxes . They also include countries outside the Islamic world such as India or China . A few cities such as Mecca or Alexandria , rivers and occasionally their sources , is- lands and tribes are also noted . The regional maps focus entirely on the Islamic world . They map Iran , Central Asia , parts of the Caucasus Mountains , the Arabian Peninsula , Iraq , the Fertile Crescent , Northern Africa , and three seas ( the Persian Sea that is the Indian Ocean ; the Mediterranean Sea ; the Caspian Sea ) . The sequence of the mapped regions and their relative delineation differs from my naming them in the sense that most extant manuscript maps show the following order and content : Arabia ; Persian Sea ; al - Maghrib ( Northwest Africa ) ; Egypt ; Syria ; Mediterranean Sea ; al - Jazira ( Northern Iraq and Southeast Turkey ) ; Iraq ( Central and South Iraq ) ; Khuzistan ; Fars ; Kirman ( parts of Iran ) ; Sind ( part of Pakistan ) ; Armenia , Arran , Azerbaijan ( part of Caucasus Mountains , Azerbaijan , and Iran ) ; Jibal ; Day- lam , Rayy , Tabaristan ( parts of Iran ) , Caspian Sea ;",

He was born in Ceuta , received his education in al - Andalus , and traveled widely in the Islamic world . Then he worked for two Norman kings , Roger II ( r . 1097-1154 ) and William I ( r . 1154-66 ) at their court in Palermo . At the end of his life , he returned to the Islamic world , possibly to Ceuta . Conceptually , he fol- lowed Ptolemaic cartographic theory and methods . He produced two sets of new maps . One was a circular world map engraved on a silver plate , which is lost . The other is a set of 70 regional maps drawn on paper . They are extant in various manuscripts across the world . Al - Idrīsī planned to combine them into one large rectangular map of the known world stretching from 180 ° in the east in the Sīlā Island ( Korea ) to the prime meridian in the west running through the Fortunate Isles . Presenting Roger not only as a successful conqueror and master of politics , he de- scribed him as the head of the cartographic project who decided on what geographical and cartographic truth was . One method applied for sorting out conflicting infor- mation was to trace with iron instruments on a drawing board all data on longitudes , latitudes , and distances . Al- Idrīsī wrote two , perhaps even three geographical texts , all of them lavishly illustrated with regional maps por- traying the entire world in a combination of Ptolemaic concepts with ideas and symbols taken from the Balkhī school . He also had access to non - Arabic oral and per- haps written sources and provided fresh information about the physical and cultural geography of European lands , not available previously in Arabic .",

They often group a multitude of localities behind one specifically chosen town whose qibla serves as a marker or representative for all the other directions . The effect of such an arrangement was di- dactic and mnemonic in the same time . The earliest known scheme of this kind is found in a manuscript copy of Ibn Khurradadhbih's ( third century h / ninth century ) Kitāb al - masālik wa'l - mamalik ( Book of the Routes and Prov- inces ) . It consists of four sectors of the world , each one of them being connected with a part of the Ka'ba - Maghrib , Egypt , Syria , al - Jazira ; Iraq , Armenia , Kashmir ; Mansūra , Tibet , China ; Yemen . Over time , the schemes became more elaborate and could comprise as many as seventy two divisions . In addition to the schemes , maps and in- struments for finding the qibla were created .

Three unnamed circles enclose eight parallel , equidistant lines identified at the right as demarcating the seven climates . Geographical features such as oceans , islands , and countries are sparsely marked by words alone . Nu- merous Arabic , Persian , and Ottoman circular and semicircular world maps also show such a scheme of climatic zones . The division into climates became the most important format of structuring the physical world in maps as well as texts . It was applied to maps of the Ptolemaic tradition , maps working within the tradition of the Balkhi schools , and maps derived from early modern European maps . Examples are the semicircular world map in ' Ayn al - Zaman's Hasan b .

Plans or sketches are also reported for planning in 141 h / 758 the new capital Baghdad of the Abbasid caliphate and possibly for waterworks in the swamps near Basra made for the sec- ond Abbasid caliph al - Mansur ( r . 136-58 h / 754-75 ) .

The most splendid examples of maps as constructs of historical memory are found in books de- scribing and eternalizing the feats of the Ottoman sultans . Many of the views of cities and ports found in Ottoman histories since the early sixteenth century celebrate ei- ther their conquest by an Ottoman sultan or an attack by a fleet in Ottoman service . According to J. M. Rogers they were also meant to visualize \" the pomp and circumstance of the Ottoman court \" . The composition of the views usually includes a representation of an abstract landscape - some mountains , some flowers , some herbs , occasion- ally also trees and animals . This theme of the landscape , its elements , and its colors is borrowed from miniature painting . The major difference between the maps and the miniatures is the complete lack of human beings in al- most all maps of this genre .",

Both rulers were keen to express their imperial claims by relying sym- bolically on the image of a globe with or without de- pictions of lands and seas . A series of images painted by Muslim and Hindu court painters between 1614 and 1658 stress the legitimacy of the ruler as a dutiful son , just defender of the interests of his subjects , and pious follower of the saints . Jahangir also used the globe for depicting his relationship to his most powerful Muslim neighbor outside of India , the Safavid Shāh ' Abbas I ( r . 986-1038 h / 1587-1628 ) . The portrait , called Jahangir's Dream , shows Jahangir as the superior and benign ruler who is connected by friendship with his smaller neighbor . Both stand on a world map that reflects knowledge of Western cartographic developments . Two animals rest at the feet of the two rulers , a lion and a lamb . The juxta- position of lion and lamb symbolized the peaceful coexistence of natural enemies , of irreconcilable contra- dictions , hence the highest good a just ruler could achieve . The symbolic globe also figures in other por- traits of Jahangir , which describe his successful squelch- ing of Khurram's rebellion , the later Shah Jahan , and his desire to destroy his political and military rival Malik ' Ambar , minister to the rulers of Ahmadnagar from 1596 to 1626. The minister valiantly opposed Mughal imperial ambitions in the Deccan and pursued a policy of steady recovery of territory conquered by Shah Akbar late in the sixteenth century . It was only ' Ambar's death in 1626 that opened the Deccan to Mughal invasion . The miniature of Jahangir shooting at a beheaded and speared Malik ' Ambar while standing on a complex cosmological alle- gory composed of a terrestrial globe seated both on an",

It started in 1948 as an engineering department of the Plan and Budget Organization . Working with foreign consultants and army officers , it carried out sur- veying work and planned the structure for the new governmental institution for mapping Iran . It focused its activities on three major domains . The first domain em- braces the creation of terrestrial maps of various prov- inces , regions , and cities of Iran and works for producing a comprehensive map of the entire Iranian territory . NCC brought foreign engineers and technicians , mainly from France and the Netherlands , for surveying the country and trained students of mathematics and physics in cartographic methods and techniques . The second domain covers the charting of Iranian coastal and mari- time areas , in particular in the Persian Gulf . The third major domain lies in creating the intellectual infra- structure for cartography in Iran . NCC created a re- search journal , organized conferences , published textbooks and the series National Atlas of Iran , and sponsored the translation of foreign publications . It has two special responsibilities - the supervision of all gov- ernment contracts and area photography .",
