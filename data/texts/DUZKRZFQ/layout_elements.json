Its history covers the last 3000 years . Emerging probably in eastern Iran , Zoroastrianism reached western Iran in the Achaemenid period ( 6th - 4th centuries BCE ) and spread to Asia Minor in late antiquity . With the rise of Islam , the Zoroastrian communities finally took refuge in eastern Persis ( sou- thern Iran ) and by migration in western India , especially Gujarat , as early as the late 3rd / 9th century ( West 1880 , 1882a ; Cereti 2007 , 212-15 ) . The Zoroastrian migration was described early in the last century ( Paymaster 1915 ; Hodivala 1920 ; Modi 1934 ; Unvala 1940 , 56-7 , colophon M 50 ) .

While the oldest layer is dominated by texts of ritual and meta - ritual nature , in the later layer , theological texts prevail . The Zand has a kind of mediating position . This historical process of reflection has changed not only the religious contents but also the intellectual style of the scholars . Two further factors were of great importance for the development of Zoroastrian literature in the Islamic period : the emergence of a literate culture and the political integration of Iran into the caliphate . Because of this integration , Zoroastrian priests had to learn to argue for their doctrines , espe- cially in the religious debates under Caliph al - Ma'mun ( r . 198-218 / 813-833 ) . This meant in particular developing tools of logic ( König 2020a ) . Although Greek philosophy was brought to pre - Islamic Iran repeatedly , it is striking that the Zand shows almost no Greek influence . Only some of the later Pahlavi literature uses philosophical terms and concepts that reflect Greek doc- trines . This suggests that in the ( late ) 2nd / 8th and 3rd / 9th centuries some Zoroastrian priests",

Moreover , the understanding of pre - Islamic Iranian access to ancient Greek and Syriac texts is complicated by the relatively widespread stories about the Sasanian recovery of knowledge destroyed centuries before by Alexander of Macedonia ( r . 336-323 BCE ) , including the Avesta , and the scholarly activities of Syriac physicians in Gundishapur in western Iran .

The Tahirids ( r . 205-259 / 821-873 ) burned Zoroastrian books ( Jackson 1906 , chapter 23 ) . In 346 / 957-958 , the Samanids ( r . c . 203-395 / c . 819-1005 ) promoted four Zoroastrians to produce a historical narrative in New Persian prose , the Book of Kings ( Shāhnāme , Nöldeke 1920 , 16 ) . The Buyids ( r . 320-447 / 932-1055 ) , in particular ' Adud al - Dawla ( r . 338- 372 / 948-983 ) , were also interested in the Zoroastrian past of Iran ( Mottahedeh 2012 , 153-60 ) . Our knowledge about Zoroastrian intellectual activities , whether religious or philosophical and scientific , rests , on one hand , on surviving manuscripts and , on the other , on information copied from earlier , now lost versions . The oldest - known Zoroastrian manuscripts stem from the Mongol period and were produced by a family of eastern Iranian scribes in Gujarat . Its ear- liest representative consists of Avestan and Pahlavi material . A scribe named Rustam Mihrābān wrote it probably between 668-677 / 1269-1278 ( Barr 1944 ; Cereti 2002 , 214 ) . This manuscript is known as K7 . Its colophon gives as a date 637 parsig ( K7b , fols . 107r - 108r , esp . fol . 107r , 15 ; cf. Geldner 1886 , vi - vii , xxxviii - xxxix ) . The oldest codices including only Pahlavi literature were written in India in the 720s / 1320s by the scribe Mihrābān Kaykhusrō from Dizūg in Sistan , today eastern Iran ( on his location , see colophon I of the manuscript K5 , Unvala 1940,128-9 and Kotwal and Hintze 2008 , 15 ; in general , see West 1896-1904 , 113 ; Dresden 1967 ; Cereti",

Mihrābān Kaykhusrō also wrote several exegetical Avestan manuscripts ( Mills 1893 ; Sanjana 1896 ; Christensen 1937-1939 ; Christensen 1941-1942 ; Barr 1944 ) . He often worked from manuscripts copied by his great - great - uncle Rustam Mihrābān mentioned earlier . Both scribes had access to different Iranian traditions ( Katrak 1941 , 245-6 ; on Mihrābān's colophons , see Westergaard 1852-1854 , 3 no.1 and 11 no.1 ; Sanjana 1896 , XXX - XXXV ; Hodivala 1920 , 118-33 ; Tavadia 1933 , column 569 ; Tavadia 1944 , 317ff ) . One tradition is linked to the sou- thern Iranian region around Kazerun and Shiraz in the 5th / 11th and 6th / 12th centuries . The other tradition points to northeastern Iran around Nishapur between 494/1100 and 648/1250 . Thus , their works prove that long before 882/1478 , when the first collection of texts was brought from Iran to India by messengers ( rivayat ) , contacts existed between Sistan and Uca at the Indus in the Punjab ( Unvala 1922 ; Dhabhar 1932 ; Vitalone 1987 ; Hodivala 1920 , 276-349 ; West 1896-1904 , 82 ) . Such early contacts are also confirmed by other material . At the begin- ning of the 5th / 11th century , for instance , another key figure in the transmission of Avestan and Pahlavi literature , the priestly scribe Mähwindad ī Naremähän i Wahrām ī Mihrābān , worked with material he had apparently received from partners in India . His networks covered a large territory , since in 410/1020 he also produced a copy of the Denkard from a manuscript he had found in Baghdad ( Andreas 1882 , 72-3 ; Geldner 1896-1904 , 14 ; Christensen 1936 ; Unvala 1940 , 152 ) . Although we possess only this kind of scattered information about Zoroastrian studies of ancient and contemporary religious and secular knowledge , the Rewayats indicate that even in the 10th / 16th century , Zoroastrian communities were still intellectually active in Khorasan , Kerman and Sistan .",

      "text": "Important intellectual activities among Zoroastrian priests took also place in India , mainly Gujarat . Between 551/1157 and 631/1234 , an eminent priest called Neryōsang was active ( Geldner 1886 , xxxiii - xxxiv ; Geldner 1896-1904 , 50 ; Damesteter 1892 , CXII - CXIII ; Eduljee 1991 , 62 ; other examples : Anquetil 1771 , 1.2 : 74 ; West 1871 , x [ 9th / 15th century ] ; Cereti and Sanjana 1991 [ 7th / 13th century ] ; Tavadia 1944 , 304 ; Boyce 1979 , 168-9 [ 5th - 6th / 11th - 12th centuries ] ) . Nēryōsang and members of his family seem to have produced Pazand transcriptions of Pahlavi texts ( Tavadia 1956 , 14 ) . It is debatable whether Pazand , the vocalized writing of Pahl- avi in Avestan characters , was invented by Něryōsang . In contrast to manuscripts produced in India , Pazand writings are only sporadically used in Iranian manuscripts . For the first time , those Zoroastrians also translated exegetical Avesta texts and Pahlavi literature into Sanskrit opening therewith new intellectual opportunities ( Bharucha 1906-1933 ) . This is proved by a note in the Paris manuscript P11 ( = Suppl . Pers . 28 / Blochet IX ) , a Sanskrit Yasna , which is a copy of the manuscript J3 ( on Neryōsang's Yasna manuscripts and translations see Geldner 1886 , xxxiii - iv ; Boyce 1979 , 168 ; Humbach 2003 , 2 : 199–202 ) .",

In Pahlavi literature , the focus of this section , only a few dates are transmitted . The most important of them is found in one of the letters written by the spiritual leader ( rad ) of Pars and Kerman , Manushchihr , to his brother Zädsparam , the priest of the community of Sirgan ( southeastern Iran ) and to the whole Zoroastrian community of Iran , dated 250 AY / 881 ( see West 1882b , III : 21 ) . Manüshchihr criticizes his brother's shortening of the purification ritual , which is required in case of contact with corpses . It is assumed that Zādsparam's innovation was stimulated by his interest in anatomy and physiology ( Sohn 1996 ) . Zādsparam's Selected Scripts ( Wizīdagihā ī Zadspram ) prove his empirical interests , his scientific work and his knowledge of Greek scientific texts . He mentions a lost zoological book Taxonomy ( Tohmag - ōshmurishnih ; Sohn 1996 , 3.57 ) and seems to have been familiar with texts by Aristotle ( 384-322 BCE ) and Hippocrates ( d . c . 370 BCE ) , among them Aristotle's Historia Animalium ( Aris- totle 1979 ) . The heading of Zädsparam's chapters 29 and 30 , called On the Structure of Human Beings ( abar passāzishni mardōman ) , may reflect Hippocrates ' On the Nature of Man ( Sohn 1996 , 32 ) .

      "text": "Rōshn , Mardānfarrokh refers several times to the work of Rōshn ( de Menasce 1945 , 10.50-8 ) . West ( 1885 , 169 no . 4 ) identifies this Rōshn with the commentator Rōshn , who is mentioned for example in Shayest - ne - shayest and Pahlavi Videvdad . He is mentioned 10 times in Pahlavi Vīdēvdād ( Cantera 2004 , 208 ) , where at one time he is in dispute with Abarag , the last com- mentator from the school of Adurfarrbay - Narsē ( Adurfarrbay - Narsē , Sōshans , Abarag ) . He pays special attention to those passages of the Denkard that are composed by Adurfarrbay and of Adurbād i Jäwandān ( or Adurbād i Jawandad or Ādarpadiiäwandą ; see de Menasce 1945 ; 4.106-7 , 9.1-3 , 10.50-8 , 1.38 ) . Adurbād i Jäwandan was probably the teacher ( bun - spas , West 1885 , 162 ; de Menasce 1945 , 109 ) of Adurfarrbay ( de Menasce 1945 , 9.1-3 ) and perhaps also the author of the lost books Denkard 1 and 2 ( West 1885 , 138-9 , no . 9 ) . It seems that Mardanfarrokh did not belong to the very dense and close circle of Persian high priests . Early wanderings ( de Menasce 1945 , 1.36-7 , 10.43-49 ; compare the wanderings of the sage ( danag ) in Menog i Khrad 1.34-60 ) led him , as he says , \" to the borders of many countries and seas \" ( de Menasce 1945 , 1.37 ; see also 10.47 ) . Perhaps a Manichaean with intimate knowledge of Manichaeism ( a sharp polemic against Mani [ \" Mānāe \" ] is found in Shkand Gumānīg Wizār 1.59-60 ) , at this time he found his \" salvation \" ( de Menasce 1945 , 1.54 , 10.58 ) especially in Zoroastrian scriptures but above all in the texts of Adurbād i Jawandan and Adurfarrbay i Farrokhzādān . His intellectually important book , which was widespread in copies in Pazand and in a Sanskrit translation in India was \" not made and arranged for the wise and experienced men , but for pupils and novices \" ( de Menasce 1945 , 1.40 ) . Parts of Mardanfarrokh's text also survived in an older Pahlavi version ( West 1885 , xxviii ; de Menasce 1945 , 159 ; see also Jâmâsp - Âsânâ and West 1887 , xxvii , xxxvii - xxxviii ; Cereti 2014 ) . Mardanfarrokh completed what began in Adurfarrbay's work . Denkard 3 and Shkand Gumānīg Wizar are connected in two important points , the development of polemical / demarcating ideas that are the results of reflection and discussion on non - Zoroastrian positions based on logical arguments and the development of a philosophical terminology and system .",

Another source attributed some of the terms in the transmission report Den- kard 4 to Aristotelian influence . The latter was written in the time of Khōsraw I ( on the age of the text manuscript B 322.4ff . , see Bartholomae 1920 , 9 , no . 2 and Cantera 2004 , 106 ; for the text see Zaehner 1955 , 7-9 , 31-4 and Cantera 2004 , 110-11 ) .

In the Indian Bundahishn , however , these elements are missing . That gives rise to the assumption that parts of the transmitted Pahlavi materials were reworked according to the categories of Adurfarrbay's ' philosophical theology ' . Hence , it is likely that at least some important Pahlavi texts are neither simply \" final versions of texts which evolved in oral transmission over long periods of time \" ( Kreyenbroek 2002 , 42-3 ) nor the late product",

      "text": "of a long and continuous tradition of Greek philosophy in Zoroastrianism ( Shaki's position in 1999 , 176 and 2003 , 323 ) . It rather seems that a faction of the Zoroastrian clergy of the late 2nd / 8th and 3rd / 9th centuries tried to reformulate Zoroastrian theology while in contact with the flourishing intellectual life of that period . This perspective receives support by the remarkable fact that there are no philosophical elements in the pre - Islamic parts of the whole Zand ( Pahlavi Videvdad ; Herbedestan / Nerangestan ) , nor do we find them in those parts that are probably later ( Pahlavi Yasna , Pahlavi Zand - e Khorde Avesta ) . But for a different view on the dating of those two parts see Skjærvo ( 2008 ) . The older parts of the Zand and of the juridical and ritualistic literature integrate commentaries of the priests ( Madayānī Hazar Dādestan ; Shayest - nē - shayest , Zand i Fragard ī Juddewdad ; König 2010a ) . A nice ( but little known ) dispute between two scholars , Gōgushasp and Mēdyōmāh , on the meaning of Avestan phrases , is found in Wizirgard ī dēnīg 24. Since Tav- adia ( 1930 ) , efforts have been made to distinguish different schools . However , the time frame of these schools is still controversial . Gignoux ( 1995 ) and Secunda ( 2012 ) prefer a post - Sasanian date . Cantera ( 2004 , 207-20 ) prefers a Sasanian dating ; according to Tavadia ( 1930 , 28-9 , 1956 , 41-4 ) , the commentators could belong to both periods . In any case , none of the translations of and commentaries on the Avesta of these schools resembles the ( philosophical ) school of Adurfarrbay .",

      "text": "The wisdom literature ( Handarz ) is also more or less unaffected by philosophical elements . It consists of a series of texts ascribed to authors , who lived in different centuries : Ādurbad ī Māraspandān and his teacher Mihr - Ohrmazd ( 4th century ) ; Khusrōy i Kawādān ( Khōsraw Anōshiravān ; r . 531-579 ) and his minister Wuzurg - Mihr ( 6th century ) ; Adurfarrbay Far- rokhzādān ( early 3rd / 9th century ) . The concept of reason or wisdom ( khrad ) is a key term in Denkard 3 and is also discussed in Pahlavi Text 17 ( König 2010b , 116-18 ) . Future comparison with the concept's use and understanding in the older text Handarz by Wehzad Farrokh Pērōz ( late Sasanid period ? ) may illuminate the development of the Zoroastrian ' philosophical the- ology ' . In comparison , the Sasanian Brih - Nask ( Denkard 8 : 9.1 ) focuses its handarz on the term asn < ud > srud khrad \" non - empirical and empirical reasoning \" . An eminent figure from the early 5th century was Ādurbād i Zardushtān ( Cantera 2004 , 217 ) . His text on the relation of the mate- rial and nonmaterial written for King Yazdegird i Shābuhragan ( r . 399-421 ) has survived ( de Menasce 1973 , 3.137 ) , along with his and Bakhtäfrid's ( 1st half 6th century ) Gnomes ( Wazagiha ) . Bakhtafrīd took part in the struggle against the Mazdakites ( Zand i Wahman Yasn 2.2 .; see Can- tera 2004 , 218-20 ) . His colleagues are partly mentioned on seals , in the Pahlavi translation and in Shayest - ne - shayest , which is a part of the Denkard ( Cereti 1995 , 175-6 ) . Bakhtäfrīd is quoted in Denkard 6 : A4 ( Shayest - ne - shayest 20.11 ) , 6 : E22a and Denkard 3 : 117. In addition , he is also known from juridical texts ( Macuch 1993 , 8.66 , 75 ; Tavadia 1930 , 8.10 ) . The range of his works resembles that of Ādurfarrbay's works from the 3rd / 9th century . Even if we cannot be sure that Aristotelian and / or Neoplatonic thoughts were adopted by Zoroastrian priests of the middle and late Sasanian period , this similarity indicates that at least Ādurfarrbay's ' intellectual stature ' , defined by a scholarly work of one and the same priest in the fields of ' philosophical theology ' , Handarz and juridical literature , has had older parallels .",
