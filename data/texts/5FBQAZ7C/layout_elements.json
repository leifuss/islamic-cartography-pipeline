Of the almost 30 texts attrib- uted to him , most await investigation . His Cosmology is the focus of our research , and we highlight its elements of similarity with Greek tradition , in particular with St Basil's Hexameron , and in the Armenian tradition , to which Anania brings novelty especially in his deeper understanding of astro- nomical phenomena . We suggest that this work , like Isidore's De Natura Rerum , represents a new genre of Christian literature , and attempts to understand it through the meaning of Cosmos found in Aristotle's De Mundo .",

      "text": "Anania Širakac'i , also known as Anania of Širak or Anania Širakuni , is regarded within the Armenian tradition as the father of mathematical sciences . Active in the 7th century AD , he is considered the first Armenian scholar to have imported a set of scientific notions , and examples of their applications , from the Greek - speaking schools into ' early Medieval ' Armenia . Writings attributed to him cover a vast array of subjects , including amongst others , arithmetic , computation , astronomy , astrology and natural philosophy . According to tradition , his writings and teachings are the heart of the autonomous development of these fields in the Armenian language , and , significantly , statues of him have been erected in prominent public spaces in the Armenian capital , Yerevan . Nevertheless , studies on this scholar are still at a relatively early stage : the exact form and breadth of his works is not yet established with certainty despite the survival of a large number of manuscripts carrying texts attributed to him .

Another extremely pre- cious tool for research is Anasyan's bibliographical compilation , dating from 1959 ( 731-774 ) . Resources available in English , French or Italian are scarce and offer no clarity about the range and identity of Anania's works.² Some of these treatises ' attributions have been unchallenged for about sixty years , or in some cases even over a hundred , so that a great part of Anania's attributed works did not withstand the scrutiny of several genera- tions of scholars . That is to say , most of Anania's heritage has not yet had the benefit of being reassessed and refined by more recent philological science , by new comparisons across oriental studies and by any new de- velopments springing from research on these centuries between ' late late antiquity ' and ' early middle ages ' , labels that sound all the more unhelpful when stretched as far as Armenia . However , it is far from our intention to dispute Anania's responsibility for any of the texts , at this stage , and we are only concerned with making a case for caution .

      "text": "It is important to mention that some texts have attracted more schol- arly attention than others , such as the Geography , historically attributed to Movses Khorenac'i , then non - unanimously attributed to Anania Širakac'i , and which has occasionally been a matter of a discussion that is unresolved to this day . Moreover , some other works attributed to Anania have very recently enjoyed the careful examination of scholars , for example the Ma- thematical Problems ( Greenwood 2011 ) , or the treatise On Weights and Measures , which Ervine and Stone identified as an Armenian version of the De Mensuris et Ponderibus by Epiphanius of Salamis ( Ervine , Stone 2000 ) . Concerning the Cosmology , Orengo has recently dispelled Abrahamyan's claim that it used Eznik as a source , and proposed that a number of images common to both authors had circulated in Greek literature for centuries be- fore ( 2009 ) . It goes without saying that a new critical edition and translation of the Cosmology would contribute to encourage more analyses of this sort . Parallel to the study to be carried out on this specific text , it is our intention to publish an updated list complete with bibliographical infor- mation about each item of this ' preliminary ' corpus .

To avoid confusion , we shall maintain the labels ' long ' and ' middle ' . Our research on the manuscript tradition is not yet developed enough to comment fruitfully on these versions . It is nonetheless important to lay out the most important differences between these traditional ' long ' and ' middle ' versions .

There might be more to support the idea that the Cosmology's dedicatee could have been Catholicos Anastas ( 661-667 ) , as the tenth - century historian Yovhannes Drasxanakertc'i , in his History of the Armenians ( uniphiu < ujng , Patmut'iwnk ' Hayoc ' ) includes a brief account of how the Catholicos re- quested Anania to produce a fixed calendar ( Greenwood 2011 , 133 ) .

      "text": "Despite a reliable critical edition not being available yet , it is possible to identify a number of sources and precise references for parts of the Cosmology . This endeavour is sometimes made easier by direct men- tions of authorities within the text itself . Muradyan highlighted a num- ber of references in the Cosmology that point mainly to Church Fathers and the Bible ( Muradyan 1976 ) ; Orengo pointed at the connections with a Greek tradition that includes Achilles Tatius and Carneades ( 2009 ) ; and our work - in - progress is adding even more references to the list . Biblical quotations are mainly drawn from the Pentateuch and Psalms , and the author often mentions St Paul , ' The Apostle ' or Movses as authorities . Given that we read in the Autobiography that Anania was well versed in the Divine Scriptures ( Greenwood 2011 , 138 ) , it is possible that he quoted by heart rather than copying . In regard to the majority of quotations drawn from Genesis , however , his use of the Bible is mediated , since they are included in his extensive borrowings from St Basil of Caesarea ( 4th century ) . Beyond St Basil , there are other doctors upon whose works the Cosmology relies , mentioned by name : Philo ( of Alexandria ) , St Gregory ( ' vardapet of the Armenians ' , i.e. The Illuminator ) and Amphiolocus ( Cosmology III.44 ) who is pre- sumably Amphiolocus of Iconium , although the reference has not yet been identified .",

As already noted by Muradyan ( 1976 ) , these quotations and references were not translated from a Greek version of this work , but rather drawn directly from its Armenian version . Comparing these texts , we have been able to find correspondences verbatim , although they often include mistakes , cuts , losses or modifications ; some bear a very close resemblance , others just display similar content . The Author of the Cosmology does not seem to make use of all nine homilies , but draws mainly from III , IV and VI , although parallels and resemblances also extend to other parts . Accordingly , not all topics considered by St Basil make an appearance in the Cosmology , whose overall structure is differently organised , as we shall remark below .",

Others are literary images used to explain certain concepts , phenomena or arguments that date to the Classical and Hellenistic period , or further back , which were used by a number of scholars or schools , and whose diffusion is hard to assess . For this latter group , examples include the image of the egg to describe the cosmos ( Cosmology III , see Orengo 2009 , 241-2 ) , or some of the arguments against the casting of horoscopes , already put forward by Carneades ( Orengo 2009 , 236-8 ) . It is important to underline that , even when it is impossible to tell precisely via which source a certain set of images and information have entered the Cosmology , their presence , acceptance and inclusion in the text may still be significant for the transmission and circulation of ideas , as they add to a picture that may be seen with better clarity in the future .",

The author discards the \" bad philosophers \" \" theory that the water flowing out is as much as the water coming into the sea , whilst the \" good philosophers \" also consider evaporation , which may explain the presence of salt and sediments , left behind by this process . The whole discussion on mechanics , however , is then judged \" not pleas- ing \" ( perhaps in the sense of ' unsatisfactory ' ) because of its inferiority to biblical passages that report the divine command for the waters to have a boundary and not to rise above the earth . God's will settles the discussion , even if it belongs to another level of understanding . Similarly , Isidore also offers examples where the how is explained by reporting pagan traditional theories , and then moves to a Christian allegorical reading of the phenom- enon , and therefore a metaphysical cause for it ( Kendall , Wallis 2016 , 21 ) . Even though one may observe that different weight is given to one or the other level , and that different schools or authors treat the physical and the metaphysical differently , these two approaches remain deeply rooted in Aristotelian philosophy .
