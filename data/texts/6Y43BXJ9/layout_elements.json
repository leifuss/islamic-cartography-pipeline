The chapter begins with a discus- sion of the classification of the astral sciences and then moves on to debates , mostly about theo- ries and to a lesser extent about practices . It concludes with a section on mathematical practices . It thus pays attention to several themes that previous surveys of the astral sciences in Islamicate societies ignored or marginalized and abstains from repeating summaries of astronomical themes found in previous surveys ( Rashed and Morelon 1996 [ CB ] ; Morrison 2013 ) .",

Abū 1 - Şaqr al - Qabişi ( mid - 4th / 10th century ) was a court astrologer of Emir Sayf al - Dawla ( r . 333-356 / 945-967 ) in Aleppo . He studied Ptolemy's Almagest and probably other works on the mathematical sciences with another astrologer in his hometown of Mosul . Among his writings as a mature astral expert are a lost trea- tise , apparently on questions concerning mathematical astronomy , called Doubts on the Almagest ( Shukuk fil - Majisți ) , intended for testing people claiming astral expertise , a lost Book on the Rea- sons behind the Astronomical Handbooks ( Kitāb ilal al - zījāt ) , the extant Treatise on the Distances and ( Heavenly ) Bodies ( Risala fi l - ab'ad wa - l - ajram ) , the extant Book on the Introduction in the Science of the Judgment of the Stars ( Kitab al - Mudkhal ilā sina'at aḥkām al - nujum ) and the extant Treatise on the Testing of Those Who Call Themselves Astral Experts ( Risala fi imtihan al - munajjimin mimman huwa muttasim bi - hadha l - ism ) . These books show that al - Qabişi was trained in all fields of the astral sciences and practiced them at the Hamdanid court . He insisted that the complete astral expert had to be solidly qualified in both species of the astral sciences ; be able to solve all of their prob- lems \" through his own intelligence , \" not the mere repetition of texts or the use of an astrolabe ; to be capable of rational demonstrations and proofs ; and to be able to compile an astronomical handbook based on direct observations , not mere re - computations of data obtained from earlier scholars ( Burnett 2002 , 203-4 ; al - Qabīşi 2004 , 2-6 ) .",

The answers to the third question usually depended on how scholars saw the role of Aristotelian epistemology as ela- borated in the Posterior Analytics in the system of the sciences . The positions taken in regard to the fourth question reflected religious beliefs , experiences with predicted results and the social status of practitioners ( Burnett 2002 ) . Behind these questions addressed to the astral sciences more general debates lurked that had emerged in antiquity : What were the status , objects and methods of the three theoretical parts of philosophy ( metaphysics , natural philosophy , the mathe- matical sciences ) , their interrelations and the character of their results ( conjectures or certain knowledge ) ? Among the ancient scholars who had grappled with these issues ( Bowen 2007 ; Feke 2014 , 2018 ) , three were certainly known through translations of parts of their works : Geminus ( c . 70 BCE ) , Hero ( 1st century ) and Ptolemy ( c . 100-170 ) . They reinterpreted the relationship and ranking between the three theoretical disciplines of philosophy in favor of the mathematical sciences , on the basis of the certainty of their proofs and hence the knowledge they engendered . It is , however , still unclear whether their opinions guided some of the debates briefly summarized in this section or inspired some of the deviating positions attributed to scholars mentioned below .",

They agreed that contrary to common belief the science of the stars was not based on conjecture and guesswork but was firmly grounded on first principles . It worked with analogical reasoning and demonstrations on the basis of reliable observations and trustworthy experience ( Abū Ma'shar 2019 [ CB ] , 1 : 46-7 , 54-69 ) . Abū Ma'shar believed that this science consisted of two species . The first was the science of the universe . This was appa- rently a mathematical science , since it contained the science of quality and quantity of the higher spheres , and because its arguments were derived from arithmetic , geometry and the science of measurement . The second , the science of the judgments of the stars , was the knowledge of the natures of the planets , the powers of their movements and their impacts on the sublunar world . Hence , it was not a mathematical science but connected to natural philosophy . These two spe- cies were not on an equal footing , since the second species received its information from the first ( Abū Ma'shar 2019 , 52-5 ) . On the other hand , Abū Ma'shar affirmed that aspects of the second species that are not obvious and clear are \" inferred by means of clear analogies ( rational arguments ) from the science of the natures of things ( physics ) \" ( Abū Ma'shar 2019 , 1 : 55 ) . At the same time , the science of the stars was universal , like medicine , but higher and nobler than this discipline , because its objects belonged to the celestial realm ( Abū Ma'shar 2019 , 1 : 68-71 ) . According to Adamson , Abū Ma'shar defended this position through theological types of rea- soning following a precedent set by al - Kindi ( Adamson 2002 , 249-51 ) .",

Al - Tawhidi ( d . 414/1023 ) , a secretary and litterateur , treated the astral sciences like the medical sciences , setting both up from the perspective of the practitioners and dividing both fields into two parts - knowledge ( ilm ) and action ( ' amal ) . While the description of medicine leaves little doubt that the practitioner should be well versed in both parts , the dis- cussion of those who contemplate the stars is more equivocal . The beginning of the description implies that the practitioner applies himself to both parts , the first part being the conditions of the stars , the differences between their ways and stations , their rising and setting , and the second being the exploration of the judgments of the stars regarding future matters . But after the enumeration of these content elements it becomes clear that it would be best to deal only with the first part . Not only are the tasks of the second part more demanding and less certain in their implementation , but the gains are also poor and the impact on society more damaging than ignorance ( which al - Tawhidi despised ) . Pursuing the first part leads directly to astonishment followed by an opening of the heart and an enlargement of the breast that reinforce belief in and veneration of God ( al - Tawhidi 1963-1964 , 267 , Arabic Pl . 2 ) .",

Their affiliation within Islam remains puzz- ling , although numerous features of their encyclopedia of 51 or 52 individual treatises ( Ikhwan al - Safa ' 1957 [ CB ] ) were believed to suggest an inclination toward several Shi'i denominations .

In this treatise , Ibn Sina presented his youthful understanding of the parts of Peripa- tetic philosophy as three theoretical sciences and three practical sciences . The astral sciences are discussed in the first two of the theoretical sciences : natural philosophy and the mathematical sciences . The second main part of the natural sciences encompasses knowledge about the main components of the universe such as the heavens , what they contain and the four elements , as established in Aristotle's On the Heavens ( Ibn Sinä 1298/1880 , 75 ) . Among the branches of the natural sciences , Ibn Sīnā lists first medicine , followed by the judgments of the stars ( Ibn Sīnā 1298/1880 , 75 ) . According to the Neoplatonic quadrivium , the science of the config- uration [ of the universe ] ( ilm al - hay'a ) is the third of the fundamental mathematical sciences .",

Under his impact and that of the Breth- ren of Purity , as well as Ibn Sina , the identification of the parts of the astral sciences shifted back and forth between natural philosophy and mathematics . This remained a constant feature of the debates in Islamicate societies until the 12th / 18th century at the very least . A second significant feature of those debates consists in partitioning the astral sciences into an increasing number of disciplinary components , which were either portrayed as independent fields of knowledge or as subdisciplines . A third aspect is the relative instability of meaning and of relationships between such designations . Similarly , outside of treatises on classification , for instance in biographical dictionaries or historical chronicles , meanings and relationships between the content of subdis- ciplines remained unstable , as did the relationships to their practitioners .",

      "text": "Al - Kindi addressed many questions concerning the universe , studying them from different perspectives . He was most interested in elucidating the connections between the celestial and terrestrial realms . He asked , for instance , how the planets can initiate transformations in the bodies of the sublunar world , if they consist of a different element , ether . How can they emit light and heat , like the element fire , when they consist of such a profoundly different element ? Why is it proper to attribute specific effects to each planet when all of them consist of one and the same element ? As his fundamental position , al - Kindi declared that God is the cause for all that happens in the universe . However , God does not act directly but is the remote agent cause . In order to bring about change , the proximate agent causes are needed . These proximate agent causes are the planets . Al - Kindi established this position by using Aristotle's theories of the four causes ( material , agent , formal , final ) , the four qualities ( hot , dry , cold , wet ) and the four ele- ments ( Adamson and Pormann 2012 , 153-4 ) . On how they achieve these changes , he offered three different lines of argumentation in different treatises apparently written in different periods of his life . According to the earliest one , planets cause sublunar processes due to the heat and friction that their movements create according to their speeds , sizes and distances . In another account , perhaps formulated late in his life , al - Kindi argued that changes happen because both planets and elements emit rays . In a third account , he attributed the planetary effects to math- ematical proportions and symbolic analogies ( Adamson and Pormann 2012 , 154-5 , 162-4 ; Orthmann 2016 , 730 ; Adamson 2020 ) . The last treatise deals with weather forecasting , while the other two are cosmological and theological in orientation . These contradictory claims sug- gest that al - Kindi continued to reflect on the complex questions about the relationship between God , the celestial realm and the sublunar world , without achieving a coherent theory . But he did argue throughout that cosmological theories appropriated from ancient philosophy , in particular Aristotle , supported the fundamental Islamic beliefs in God's role in the world ( Adamson and Pormann 2012 , 155-6 ) .",

Abū Ma'shar combined these basically Aristotelian ideas with Platonic concepts such as the form that is the defining feature of each thing and operates like an artisan , while the four sublunary elements are its tools .

These challenges may have emerged ( at least partly ) from some of the epistemo- logical views expressed by Hellenistic scholars , in particular Ptolemy . But there is not enough research to come to a definitive conclusion . Thabit ibn Qurra may have even questioned the entire physical doctrine of Aristotle ( Rashed 2009 , 676-7 ) . But we cannot be certain because not enough of his treatises on these issues have survived . The surviving fragments indicate his rejection of Aristotle's theories of natural place , the nonexistence of the void , the definition of time as a measure of celestial movement and some of the properties of movement . He also seems to have been indecisive about the role of the Prime Mover in the movements of the spheres ( Rashed 2009 , 683-99 ) . Al - Bīrūni is well known for his rejection of several Aristotelian natural philosophical doctrines in his letters to Ibn Sina ( al - Biruni and Ibn Sina 1970 ) .

      "text": "One of those discussions concerned the existence of spheres beyond the sphere of the ecliptic ( the path of the mean sun , also called the sphere of the zodiac or the sphere of fixed stars ) , the eighth and perhaps outermost sphere . Following Aristotle , Ptolemy had declared the movements of the heavens to originate due to a Prime Mover situated in the sphere beyond the ecliptic . In the 3rd / 9th century , the Banu Mūsā rejected the existence of such a ninth sphere in their Book on the Motions of the Celestial Spheres ( Kitāb Harakat al - aflāk ) . The brothers explained the daily motion by the rotations of each single sphere from the moon to the fixed stars ( Casulleras 2007 , 1 : 93 ) . One of the them , Ahmad , reportedly delivered a geometrical proof against the existence of the ninth sphere ( Casulleras 2007 , 1 : 93 ) . In the following cen- turies , arguments for more spheres than eight were also offered due to other observational results . An important issue was the precession of the equinoxes . According to Ptolemy this slow movement along the ecliptic of the two points of intersection between the ecliptic and the celestial equator was due to the slow eastward rotation of the sphere of the fixed stars around the ecliptic poles . Another phenomenon seemingly requiring additional external spheres was the apparently changing obliquity of the ecliptic ( the angle of intersection between the ecliptic and the equatorial planes ) which was explained by increasingly complex theories of trepidation ( Ragep 1996 ) . Identifying in the 4th / 10th century the ancient divine Prime Mover or the First Cause with Allah , facilitated the model's spread beyond the circles of astral experts . Two cen- turies later , scholars engaged in planetary theory defined the ninth sphere as a fixed coordinate system ( Ragep 1996 , 286 ) .",

In a letter on weather forecasting , a subfield of the astral sciences , al - Kindi argued that four spheres existed on each side of the sun ( al - Kindi 2000 , 245-6 ) . The upper spheres were those of Mars , Jupiter , Saturn and the fixed stars . The lower spheres consist , in addition to the sphere of the moon , of three single spheres for the following pairs : Venus and Mercury ; fire and air ; water and earth . Al - Kindi believed that Mercury and Venus were equidis- tant from the sun and hence should be placed in a single sphere together ( al - Kindi 2000 , 245-6 ) . His justification for putting water and earth , as well as fire and air , in single spheres reflects Aristotelian physics : water and earth are both cold and heavy , move downward to the center and do not form clearly ordered spheres , as earth rises above water in many places ( continents and islands ) . They were often treated as forming a composite sphere . Similarly , air and fire are both hot and light , move upward and may not be separated from each other by a simple geometrical boundary ( al - Kindi 2000 , 245 ) .",

We do not know if other scholars in Islamicate societies subscribed to al - Kindi's views . There are , however , some diagrams in Ara- bic and Persian texts that present at least the sublunar world in agreement with al - Kindi's model . A comment by Nasir al - Din al - Ṭūsi ( 597-672 / 1201-1274 ) , in his Recension of the Almagest ( Tabrir al - Majisti ) , also might point to a longer life of this view . He discussed earlier observations of the transits of Venus . Some of these are clearly spurious , but others are possibly correct . Using this evidence , he rejected the ideas that the two inferior planets are in the sphere of the sun and that the centers of their epicycles coincide with the center of the sun's body ( Mozaffari 2016 , 276 , no . 40 ) .",

They argued for the sidereal year ( the time of one revolution of the sun with regard to the fixed stars , in modern terms about 1 h 20 m longer than the tropical year ) , which they considered of the same length as the anomalistic solar year ( the time of one revolution of the sun with regard to its apogee , in modern terms some 2 h 55 m shorter than the sidereal year ) . Their arguments went back and forth between natural philo- sophy , mathematical astronomy and observations . Their arguments made use of solar observations that the Banu Mūsā brothers had executed in Baghdad , together with what they perceived as the critical spirit of ancient Greek astronomy . They presented their own observations not merely as new observational results but as part of a history of observations , which included - as an impor- tant method - an explicit criticism of earlier observations by ancient scholars ( Neugebauer 1962 ; Morelon 1994 , 116 ; Chapter II.7 ) .",

In a treatise called On the Motion of the Eighth Sphere extant only in Latin translation ( Liber de motu de octaue sphere ) - also attributed falsely to Thabit ibn Qurra - these issues are represented in the first known qualitative geometrical model ( Neugebauer 1962 , 291-9 ; for possible authors of the Arabic treatise see Samsó 1994 , I : 15 , 2020 [ CB ] , 585 ) . The model resulted from and contributed to the continued discussion of what was called trepidation or the motion of accession and recession . The assumption , already formulated in late antiquity in Greek and Indian works but without geometrical models , was that the equinoctial points move forward and backward at a rate of 1 ° / 80 years along an arc of 8 ° . In the ancient mathematical model , the longitude of a star will decrease during the forward west - to - east movement ( accession ) . During the backward east - to - west movement ( recession ) it will increase again until it reaches its original value .",

In his refutation of ten kinds of criticisms against astrology , Abū Ma'shar explains that experts in mathematical astronomy are insufficiently trained if they do not know natural philosophy or practice the science of the judgments of the stars , because the latter is the fruit of astral knowledge ( Burnett 2002 , 209 ; al - Qabişi 2004 , 6-7 ) . This view on the connectedness of mathematical astronomy and astrology was still held in the early 9th / 15th century , when either the Timurid prince Iskandar Sultan or possibly one of his court astrologers wrote in the preface to an other- wise lost scientific summa that the science of the configuration [ of the universe ] is the foundation of the noble science of the stars and the latter the fruit of all the parts of mathematical astronomy ( Brentjes 2009 , 465 ) .",

      "text": "The most important discussions on astrological methods and their mathematical implementa- tion took place in astronomical handbooks and specialized treatises ( Kennedy and Krikorian 1972 , 3-4 ; Casulleras and Hogendijk 2012 ) . They concern three fundamental theories that historical actors considered interrelated : ( 1 ) the theory of houses , ( 2 ) the theory of aspects and ( 3 ) the theory of rays . Houses ( also translated as places ; not to be confused with the domiciles of the planets ) resulted from the division of the ecliptic circle or the zodiacal belt into 12 parts . They could either have fixed or mobile limits , often defined by the projection of divisions from an auxiliary great circle like the equator onto the ecliptic ( Kennedy 1996 ) . Similarly , there were different views on how to determine the seven astrological aspects , significant points of rays allegedly cast by a planet , and predictions for any given date by progressions . Casulleras and Hogendijk have traced nine methods for projecting rays and identified six methods for predictions made by progression ( Casulleras 2009 ; see Casulleras and Hogendijk 2012 for a survey of the older literature , editions and translations of primary sources and the details of the general themes , as well as their respective methods ) . They consider methods ( also called systems ) as different when their geometrical definitions are not mathematically equivalent ( Casulleras and Hogendijk 2012 , 37 ) . As a result , the computations employed can also differ . Some of the systems are mathematically interrelated , while others are indepen- dent . The applied mathematical practices are nontrivial and should thus be acknowledged as valuable contributions to the history of the mathematical sciences in Islamicate societies ( see , for instance , Hogendijk 2015 , 285 ) .",

The evaluation by practitioners concerned eight issues related to each other in different ways . The first four were the effectiveness , reliability and applicability of each of the methods for specific pla- netary and imagined celestial positions and the soundness of a method . These formed one complex . The relationship between methods and the possibility of extending a method to a more complex case reflect a second set of questions . The remaining two issues were the exact or approximate character of the computations and were related to a methodological problem also raised outside the astral sciences . This also applies to the question of which mistakes various authors had committed ( Casulleras and Hogendijk 2012 , 43 , 45 , 56-7 , 59 , 63-4 , 70 , 73 , 81 , 83 , 91 ) .",

They needed to know the relevant great and small circles , arcs and angles on the celestial and terrestrial spheres and how to do geometrical constructions with a ruler and a compass . They had to be able to transform verbal statements into plane or spherical diagrams and vice versa . In more advanced mathematics , they needed to handle proportions between numbers or geometrical magnitudes , work with trigonometric magnitudes and relations , trisect arcs or angles , to project elements of a spherical surface or a plane unto another plane and make a linear interpolation between two values . More rarely quadratic interpolations were used . Last , they had to be able to translate geometrical problems or procedures into arithmetical or algebraic ones and thus recognize equivalences between problems from different fields of the mathematical sciences , which allowed them to search for arithmetical or algebraic solutions ( Chapters 1.5 and 1.7 ) .",

The mathematical proce- dures used for such higher - level astrological practices were the same that the experts used for calculations and constructions in the mathematical part of the astral sciences ( astronomy ) . The same holds for proofs and demonstrations or the preference of exact solutions over approximate ones . Exact solutions occur primarily in discussions of theoretical problems of the astral sciences . Casulleras assumes that more complex formulations of theories and their procedures led to an increase in scholarly reputation , which in turn inspired the creation of more difficult theories involving efforts to find more sophisticated mathematical solutions ( Casulleras 2004 , 385-6 ) .",

Astrology was excluded until very recently ( Burnett 2007 ; Morrison 2013 ) . A survey of the various complex and difficult mathematical methods used for predictions of the future still needs to be written . It is not possible to separate astrology from mathematical astronomy on the grounds that it is not considered a science today . If we did this , we would also have to abandon mathematical astronomy , since its natural philosophical founda- tions and its models are also faulty and equally contradict reality as understood today . The themes presented here indicate the fruitfulness of studying the different parts of the astral sciences as a unified field of knowledge interrelated by epistemological and natural philosophical issues of great importance , a broad range of mathematical methods and sociocultural contexts .",
