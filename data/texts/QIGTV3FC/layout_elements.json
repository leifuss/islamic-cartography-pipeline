This [ reflection ] is verified in conformity with the position of the pupil with respect to the mirror .

The third [ principle ] , instead , is that by which one recognizes that the position of the bent ray , which is found between the pupil and the mirror and between the mirror and the thing that is to be seen , is such that each of these two [ segments ] arrives at the point in respect to which the break occurs , while they contain , parting from the mirror , angles equal with the perpendicular line that exits from the very same point .",

It is just as it occurs in the things that appear opposite from one part and from the other , when the gaze will fall at right angles onto the mirror and it reflects upon itself .

Then the line DG is extended until it meets at L the line KL , which is perpendicular to the line AG . We have moved from T to L , and this movement has taken place on the equivalent side where the real object Z has been moved to K. At paragraph 94,43 it is observed that if the image BG of ZK is above the viewpoint , TL will also appear in the upper part in respect to the eye ( Fig . 99 ) . The visual ray , in fact , sees farther above that which is higher up and farther below that which is lower down . At paragraph 95 , by turning one's gaze from D toward ZK ( Fig . 98 ) , one sees that K is to the right of Z , but by turning one's gaze toward TL , one notices that G , which is the image of L , the virtual of K , is found on the right of B : therefore , a point that is on the right appears on the left and vice versa . Paragraph 9645 notes that this is a deception that the mind overcomes through the knowledge of the principles that we have studied .",

The shadows that the sun generates by projecting the vertex of the gnomon onto the horizontal plane are , at our latitudes , hyperboles ( Figs . 105 , 106 ) . This too is a scenographic or perspectival projection , but because the center of projection is the vertex of the gnomon , it has been given the name centrographic or gnomonic projection .",
