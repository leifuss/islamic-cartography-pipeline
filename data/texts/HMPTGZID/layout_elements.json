This general rule of noncorrespondence between theological school and cosmog- raphy requires qualification : ( 1 ) , the Ash'aris are consistent in their occasionalism , which shapes their views on , e.g. , the cause of the immobility ( wuquf ) of the earth , and ( 2 ) , the Maturidis are not \" genetically \" or geographically linked to the other three major schools , and are therefore typically less interested in exploring questions of cosmography in a kalām con- text . 17 With these qualifications , the rule of noncorrespondence holds . My third intervention relates to questions of diachronic development . Up to the early sixth / twelfth century there is no evidence of a trend of increasing accommodation of Greek cosmography by theologians of the four main rationalist schools . The question of the shape of the earth , for example , continued to be contested . This remained true even as the distinction between astronomy ( Film al - hay'a ) and astrology ( aḥkām al - nujum ) emerged with greater clarity , and the former was ( increasingly ) shorn of metaphysical assumptions - developments that would clearly facilitate such an accommodation . 18 To make my case , I draw on the published corpus of kalām treatises of the period , along with Quran commentaries authored by theologians , and , occasionally , works from other genres . My evidentiary basis for these conclusions is com- prehensive , though by no means exhaustive , and will admittedly have to be revised as new sources come to light .",

Because the traditionalist cosmography includes material about the structure and composition of the heav- ens and the earth , there is a certain overlap with the discourse of the astronomer - astrologers ( munajjimūn ) of the period . I have already alluded to the problem of disaggregating astrol- ogy and astronomy , which needs still to be treated systematically in its Islamicate context . 22 In addressing the formative period of Islamic thought , in particular , one cannot avoid the problem of the dearth of extant sources . Unfortunately , these problems continue beyond the second / eighth century . Large multivolume works such as the Quran commentary ( tafsir ) of Abū ' Ali al - Jubba'ī ( d . 303 / 915f . ) are lost to us , surviving only in quotation ( especially by later Twelver authors , because of their Mu'tazili commitments ) . 23 Where possible I have sought to corroborate quotations of lost works by drawing on multiple sources , including the five - volume series Mawsu'at tafasir al - mu'tazila and the recently published encyclopaedic al - Tahdhib fi al - tafsir of al - Hakim al - Jishumi ( d . 494/1101 ) , both published in Beirut . 24 As a general rule , there is a high degree of consistency in the cosmographical views attributed to early theologians by later authors .

      "text": "Given the relatively late provenance of the extant sources , it is worth pausing to comment on the development of traditionalist cosmography in the postquranic period . I propose that this proceeded ( no later than the first half of the second Islamic century ) from two major impulses . The first was the explication of quranic material on the subject . The Prophet may have done this himself , and the same may be true of Ibn ' Abbas ( d . 68/687 ) and his circle , among other early Muslims credited for their activities in tafsir . 41 Much cosmographical material is also attributed to transmitters of the so - called Isra'īliyyat , 42 such as Ka'b al - Aḥbār ( d . ca. 32/652 ) and Wahb b . Munabbih ( d . 131/748 ) . Ascribing definite cosmographical views to any of these early figures is , of course , fraught with difficulty given the problems of the sources . Nonetheless , based on a perusal of the tafsir of Muqātil b . Sulayman ( d . 150/767 ) , the key features of traditionalist cosmography were evidently in circulation by the time of his death in 150h , that is , no later than the first half of the second century , and I shall adduce Muqatil's tafsir as evidence of the early date of various features of this cosmography . 43 The second major impulse was the attempt to situate the Prophet's life in the context of a broader sacred history . The Sira of Ibn Ishaq ( d . 150/767 ) is known to have originally consisted of three parts , the first of which , al - Mubtada ' , addressed origins and the history of the prophets to the emergence of Islam . 44 As such , it is extremely likely to have included cosmographical traditions . 45 Unfortunately , owing to the transmission of the Sīra , reconstructing this element of the text is likely to prove very challenging . 46",

      "text": "Muslim awareness of the Aristotelian - Ptolemaic cosmography predates the apogee of the Translation Movement by several decades . The earliest opinions on the subject from mutakallimūn , preserved in later doxographies and other sources , already reflect familiarity with Aristotle , as noted by Josef van Ess . 74 Hisham b . al - Hakam ( d . 179 / 795f . ) , a disciple of the Shi'i Imam Ja'far al - Sadiq ( d . 148/765 ) , played the leading role in introducing cosmo- graphical questions to kalām ; his lead was followed by younger contemporaries , including Abu al - Hudhayl al - ' Allaf ( d . 226 / 840f . ) and al - Nazzam ( d . 220/835 or 230/845 ) . 75 Though it is not clear precisely when the distinction between the \" subtleties \" ( daqiq , also latif , ghamiḍ ) and \" main topics \" ( jalil ) of kalām emerged , cosmography belonged firmly to the former domain and generated disagreement from the outset . 76 Cosmography was a standard feature of the discourse of the mutakallimūn , and the main lines of inquiry were already well estab- lished , before they received focused elaboration at the hands of theological systematizers toward the end of the third / ninth century . Cosmographical discussion in this period occurs in the context of questions of bodies , motion , and void ( i.e. , physics ) and , to a lesser extent , in the refutation of other religions . On all of these issues , dialogue and polemical exchange with non - Muslims seem to have been the main driver of opinion . The relative paucity of material on cosmography , moreover , suggests that it was rather incidental to larger , more narrowly \" theological \" debates .",

He is reported to have refuted the opinion that the earth extends infinitely in all directions , which Aristotle attributes ( with some variation ) to Xenophanes of Colophon.77 The earth's suspension in place raised important theological questions about God's role in the maintenance of the cos- mos , hence the sustained interest of mutakallimün in the subject . Hisham is claimed to have taught that the earth rests on a body with a tendency to ascend ( jism sa \" ad ) , which counter- acts the earth's tendency to fall , thus keeping the latter in place . 78 By seeking a rationalistic explanation for the earth's suspension , as opposed to assuming it rests ( e.g. ) on the back of a cosmic fish , Hisham implicitly rejects the traditionalist cosmography . There is , however , no hint in the sources as to his views on the shape of the earth . Hisham is also reported to have persuaded a Zoroastrian priest ( mūbadh ) that there is nothing beyond the ( finite ) cosmos , i.e. , that we would not be able to see anything or extend an outstretched hand beyond its bor- ders . 79 We also know that he was associated with corporealism , famously advocating God as the possessor of \" a body unlike bodies , \" located above the throne . 80 It is not clear , however , what bearing this had on his views on more strictly cosmographical questions .",

Ibrāhīm al - Rassi ( d . 246/860 ) . 92 Unlike Hishām , Abū al - Hudhayl , and al - Nazzām , al - Rassī spent most of his career in the cultural backwater of Medina , far removed from the cutting- edge developments of Baghdad and Basra . 93 He seems to have been relatively well informed on the cosmographical opinions of various non - Muslim groups , however , most likely as the result of a sojourn in Egypt , where he is known to have interacted with Jews and Chris- tians . Al - Rassi's cosmographical views emerge with a clarity atypical of earlier generations . He explicitly rejects cosmographical traditionalism , condemning the proto - Sunnis ( hashw hādhihi al - umma ) for their belief that the earth rests on the back of a fish ( hut ) . 94 He advo- cates the view that the earth is kept aloft by a mixture of void and air ( hawa ' ) beneath it , not- ing and dismissing the alternatives that the earth is , variously , the foundation of the cosmos , that it floats on a cosmic sea , that it seeks its \" natural place \" ( as per Aristotle ) , and that there is only void beneath it , or only air . 95 Kitāb al - Dalil al - kabir contains nothing on the shape of the earth , but it is not unlikely that al - Rassī pondered this question , though extant kalām sources do not address the issue until later in the century . 96",

Al - Nawbakhti is known to have written against Abū ' Ali al - Jubba'i's critique of the science of the stars . 103 Notwithstanding this , however , al - Nawbakhti was decidedly opposed to Aristotle , the pagans of Harran , and other exponents of that branch of learning . He produced an early account of the divergent views on the sub- ject among Muslims and non - Muslims that demonstrates extensive firsthand knowledge , including of Aristotle's De Caelo and its commentaries . 104 Al - Nawbakhti is not always con- sistent in naming some of the mutakallimūn associated with particular cosmographical opin- ions . 105 He ascribes the opinion that the earth rests \" on the back of a fish [ ... ] on the horn of a bull [ ... ] standing on the ground ( thara ) \" to a group among the proto - Sunnis ( qawm min ahl al - ḥadīth ) , without commenting on it . 106 Like Abu al - Hudhayl , al - Nawbakhti refutes the perpetual downward fall of the earth by appealing to the example of an object dropped to the ground ( a feather or a clod of mud ) . 107 Notwithstanding his very extensive exposure to late ancient knowledge , however , he remained \" in outlook a Muslim kalām theologian , not a phi- losopher , \" and shared \" the basic rationalist principles of the Mu'tazila . \" 108 His wide - ranging criticisms of the astronomers and astrologers ( Madelung's translations of munajjimūn and aşḥāb al - aḥkām respectively ) was to prove a valuable source for later theologians of dispa- rate tendencies , including the idiosyncratic Hanbali Ibn al - Jawzi ( d . 597/1201 ) . 109",

His role as the leading figure of Basran Mu'tazilism in his generation - or even its architect , in some accounts - likely explains the devotion to preserving his opinions by scholars of later generations . Though Abū ' Ali's importance to the school came to be eclipsed by his son Abū Hashim , we are much better informed about the cosmographical opinions of the former .

The major development is the theological careers of Abu al - Hasan al - Ash'arī and Abū Mansur al - Māturīdī . Neither seems to have been especially important during his lifetime , and one cannot speak of Ash'ari or Maturidi \" schools \" until well after their deaths . 131 Neverthe- less , with their advent one can retrospectively speak of the beginnings of what would become classical Sunni theology , with all that this entails for cosmographical doctrine .",

      "text": "Ess's thesis . 137 Al - Ash'arī's presentation of the competing views of the mutakallimūn on the subject is dispassionate , and it is unclear which of the four opinions he reports is regarded as the correct one . Ibn Furāk provides the necessary information . He notes that al - Ash'arī held that \" there is no reason for the suspension of the earth [ in place ] other than God's volition ( ikhtiyar ) . \" 138 Of the four solutions documented in Maqālāt al - islamiyyin , this cor- responds most closely to the view , attributed to Abu al - Hudhayl , that the earth does not rest on a body . 139 Al - Ash'arī explicitly rejects , in good occasionalist fashion , all alternative causal accounts of the earth's immobility , whether produced by advocates of taba'i ' ( the four elemental qualities ) 140 or tawallud ( Mu'tazilis ) : \" God , the most exalted , is the one who holds the earth [ in place ] , preserves , and oversees it , [ the one who ] renders the mobile bod- ies thereon immobile , by his will . \" 141 Similarly , in al - Ash'ari's Risāla ilā ahl al - thaghr it is God alone who prevents the firmament from collapsing onto the earth ( echoing Q 22:65 ) . 142 Al - Ash'arī repudiated all claims about the inherent \" nature \" of bodies , whether it was the supposed tendency of fire to rise or of stones to fall , and , like Hisham b . al - Hakam , he denied that one could stretch a hand beyond the cosmos . 143 The view that the earth is hurtling downward , attributed by Ibn Fürak to the materialists ( Dahriyya ) , is rejected by al - Ash'arī , as is the ( more unusual ) opinion that it floats upward , also ascribed to them . The opinion that the earth is comprised of parts whose properties counteract each other ( the fourth solu- tion presented in Maqālāt al - islamiyyin ) is also refuted , as is the claim that it rests on a body that is re - created every moment for this purpose ( solution three ) : God instead re - creates the accident of motionlessness ( fi'l al - sukun ) in it every instant . 144 The bottom surface ( al - safiḥa al - sufla ) of the earth cannot be described as either immobile or moving , al - Ash'arī points out , seemingly because it cannot be described as having a place ( makan ) . 145 To summarize his contributions to the debate , al - Ash'arī takes the cosmographical framework of the Mu'tazilis as his point of departure , while rejecting most of the solutions they proposed to its most enduring problems , e.g. , the cause of the earth's immobility . His occasionalist commitments are the cause of these divergences . At no point in his extant work does al - Ash'arī explicitly reference traditionalist cosmography , though by denying that the earth rests on a body , he implicitly rejects one important element of it .",

In nearly all of the key verses where one might expect to find his commentary on the relevant verses to be inflected by kalām debates , al - Māturīdī either endorses traditionalist positions explicitly or reports them without comment . He seems to be unaware of Mu'tazili views on these points , or at the very least refrains from discussing them . In his tafsir of Q 18 : 86 - as we have seen , a site of Mu'tazili cosmographical intervention since at least the time of Abū ' Ali al - Jubba'i - al - Māturīdī lim- its himself to mentioning variae lectiones . 147 In his exegesis of Q 50 : 1 he acknowledges the world - encompassing mountain range ( made of green or red ruby ) , but suggests that this cannot be the correct interpretation as \" the [ pagan ] Arabs knew nothing of Mt. Qaf or its greatness . \" 148 God would not swear an oath , presumably , by anything unfamiliar to the origi- nal , mostly pagan audience of the quranic revelation . Al - Maturīdī's reading of Q 65:12 is revealing of his general approach to the subject . He notes three interpretations for the seven earths : that they are layered one above the other like the heavens ( as per the traditionalist view ) ; that these \" earths \" are in fact seven continents ( jaza'ir ) ; 149 and that the six earths are located somewhere beyond the lowest heaven ( al - sama ' al - dunya , Q 67 : 5 ) . Refusing to com- mit himself to any of these options , al - Māturīdī writes , \" We have no need to know the nature , modality , or number of [ the earths ] , because there is no legal ruling ( hukm ) attached thereto , and God knows best . \" 150 This attitude clearly diverges sharply from the approach of the Mu'tazilis , who had no qualms about entertaining such conjectures . Al - Māturīdī only affirms figurative interpretations of cosmographical data when the proper understanding of God's attributes is at stake , as in the case of the throne and the footstool . 151 He does mention the possibility that the firmament is not held up by pillars , but this view is also reported by the contemporaneous al - Tabarī , and has no necessary connection to the mutakallimūn as such . 152",

      "text": "Thus , by the early fourth / tenth century , key patterns of cosmographical thinking ( in the context of schools of kalām ) had emerged that would have a decisive bearing on subsequent developments . Following his conversion , al - Ash'arī committed himself to occasionalism— which would endure as a distinctive feature of Ash'ari theology - while retaining an interest in the kalām questions and methods of his Mu'tazili teachers , including those pertaining to cosmography . Al - Māturīdī's vision of the cosmos was , on the other hand , much more closely related to that of al - Tabarī than to that of the Mu'tazila , and he was not exercised by the same set of questions . Even among the Mu'tazilis , formative exposure to the traditionalist disciplines ( most importantly , hadith ) could produce a corresponding inclination , as we have seen with Ibn al - Ikhshīd . Overall , among these three theologians of clearly divergent view- points , theological affiliation is not an accurate index of cosmographical opinion . Similar conclusions may apply outside the Muslim community for this period : the Jewish mutakal- lim Dawūd al - Muqammaş ( d . ca. 325/937 ) , whom most scholars regard to have been deeply influenced by the Mu'tazilis , claims that the earth is discoid and the sky dome - shaped , in good Talmudic fashion . 155",

Similarly , among the Twelver Shi'a , Ibn Bābawayh ( d . 380/991 ) established his reputation as star theologian of the community in Baghdad , before returning eastward . The career of his student al - Shaykh al - Mufid , a resident of the city , marked a major turning point in the his- tory of Twelver theology .

None of the dubious reports about the angelic bearers of the throne , he notes , is widely transmitted ( i.e. , they are aḥādī ) , and so do not constitute part of correct doc- trine . 171 Al - Mufid defines the cosmos ( ' alam ) in two places as \" the sky and the earth , what- ever they contain and whatever is between them . \" 172 In his Awa'il al - maqālāt , he concurs with al - Balkhi and the munajjimūn in believing the earth to be an immobile sphere at the center of the cosmos . This location at the center ( fi al - markaz ) is the cause of the earth's immobility - contra al - Jubba'ī père et fils , as well as many other theologians . 173 Much like al - Balkhi in a previous generation , al - Mufid's views align very closely with the advocates of the science of the stars , at least as far as narrow questions of cosmography are concerned . 174 Like al - Balkhi - distinctively among the Baghdad Mu'tazilis - al - Mufid denies the existence of intracosmic void , against most of the mutakallimūn and the Ash'aris ( i.e. , mutakallimī al - ḥashwiyya wa - ahl al - jabr wa - l - tashbih ) . 175 This seemingly deliberate alignment with al - Balkhi , the chief of the Baghdad Mu'tazilis , is explained by al - Mufid's general sympathy for the Baghdad school , which would shift in his students ' generation . Al - Mufid's inclination toward the cosmographical views of the munajjimūn was echoed by his student Abū al - Fath al - Karājikī ( d . 449/1057 ) , whose endorsement is , if anything , more full - throated . 176",

Al - Ka'bi's mistaken view entails that if one dug deep enough into the earth , eventually the stars and heavens would be visible beneath one's feet , and this is absurd . 186 Ibn Mattawayh condemns the masses ( ' ämma ) for their belief that the earth rests on the back of some animal ( hayawan ) .

' Abd al - Qahir al - Baghdādī , a student of al - Isfara ini ( alongside whom he was buried ) , 188 condemns their views at length , deferring to largely traditionalist positions on cosmography . His exposition of the subject in Kitāb Usul al - din expands on the treatment in al - Ash'ari's Maqālāt al - islamiyyin , on which it is evidently based . 189 In the course of his sur- vey , al - Baghdādī mentions more obscure ancients , including Eudoxus of Cnidus ( Qanādūs , d . 337 BCE ) and Menelaus of Alexandria ( Mīlāwūsh , d . 140 CE ) . 190 Muslims , Jews , and Chris- tians , al - Baghdādī informs us , are all agreed that the earth is immobile , with the exception of the occasional earthquake afflicting its inhabitants . On this point , they concur with such luminaries as Plato , Aristotle , Ptolemy , and Euclid . Other opinions include the notion that the earth spins on its axis while remaining in place ( Eudoxus , and allegedly Menelaus ) , or the view that it is the earth that moves and the firmament that is fixed , contra the munajjimūn . 191 Following al - Ash'arī , al - Baghdādī's main purpose in the discussion is to argue that the earth remains in place only by virtue of God's power : \" God [ ... ] has suspended it [ in place ] nei- ther by means of a body [ on which it rests ] nor by means of the air that encompasses it . \" 192 In a later chapter he foregrounds his cosmographical traditionalism , writing that the seven heavens are stationary plates ( sg . tabaq ) one above the other and the \" stars ( kawākib ) are all located in the lowermost heaven , \" against the astronomers , who claim that the firmament is a sphere . 193 He insists that the heavens are both flat and immobile , and is even more strident on these points in his heresiography , al - Farq bayn al - firaq . 194 In his recently published al - Asma ' wa - l - sifat , al - Baghdādī similarly criticizes the munajjimūn for diverging from the correct view on \" the layout ( sura ) of the heavens , the stars , [ and ] the earth [ ... ] . \" 195",

In it he reviews the debate on the shape of the earth , finally upholding its flatness against the claims of Aristotle's De Caelo and Ptolemy's Almagest . 203 Al - Naysābūrī produces three main arguments to prove the earth is flat , in addi- tion to refuting several objections . If the earth were round , he writes , it would be equidistant at all points from the firmament , like a dot drawn at the center point of a circle . If this were the case , one would not see the sun rise and set , nor would it appear higher and lower in the sky at various points during the day , increasing and decreasing in size , because it would not move farther from or draw closer to the earth in the course of its daily cycle . 204 Furthermore , bodies of water would not remain in place on a round earth ; there would be nothing to keep them from falling into the surrounding air . Finally , the earth's roundness contradicts the straightforward meaning of Q 79:30 , according to which God spread out or \" flattened \" the earth ( daḥāhā ) following its creation . 205 While al - Naysābūrī does note that this verse can be interpreted as referring to parts rather than to the whole of the earth ( the view favored by al - Murtadā ) , he does not ultimately agree . 206 He does not express his opinion in a tone that",

Al - Ṭūsi concurs with Abū ' Ali al - Jubba'ī that the firmament is not held up by pillars , 210 and like him refuses to identify the quranic heavens ( samāwāt ) with the spheres of the astrono- mers , on the grounds that the former ( like the earth ) are immobile . 211 Al - Ṭūsī also affirms the existence of the seven earths , but implies that six are uninhabited . 212 His tafsir bears the impress of Abū ' Ali's , so it is perhaps no surprise to note that , like al - Murtaḍā , he inclined to Basran positions .",

This is perhaps unsurprising given cosmography's location in daqiq al - kalām , beyond the domain of \" theology \" proper and so subject to perennial dispute ( at least in theory ) . Nevertheless , it seems clear that the practitio- ners of scientific astronomy had not made tremendous headway in persuading the theological thought - leaders of Islamdom to accept even their premises , e.g. , the roundness of the earth or the earth's location at the center of a system of concentric heavenly spheres . These con- cessions would eventually emerge among theologians , but not in the period under scrutiny . Though it can hardly be much more than conjecture , given the state of the field , I would like to suggest in parting that al - Ghazālī made a significant contribution toward facilitating the rehabilitation of the Aristotelian - Ptolemaic view ( at least in its broadest outlines ) . 219 Judging from the evidence of its citation history , the material on the cause of eclipses in his al - Mungidh and Tahāfut seems to have exercised broad influence . 220 If proven , al - Ghazālī would seem to have had the same effect on rehabilitating Greek cosmography as he did on logic . The two are interesting parallel cases , beginning on the margins of theological discourse before working their way into the disciplinary toolkit of postclassical religious learned culture . 221 Mounting this argument in detail is evidently beyond the scope of this paper . It is clear , however , that even after the mutakallimūn had embraced the main fea- tures of the Aristotelian - Ptolemaic view , works of traditionalist cosmography continued to",

On all of these points , al - Balansi con- tradicts traditionalist doctrine . On the second charge , specifically , one should note that early Muslims relied on nonscientific means for determining the direction of the Ka'ba ( along with prayer times , etc. ) . The adoption of other ( mathematical ) means , following the translation of late ancient learning into Arabic , met with resistance in Iberia ( and presumably elsewhere ) , as noted by David King . 228 Ibn ' Abd Rabbih's main argument against the roundness of the earth seems to be that lands separated by vast distances experience the same seasons at the same time .
