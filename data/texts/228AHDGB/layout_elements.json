      "text": "It would be difficult to say , at least in a brief summary , how the Arabs of the pre - Islamic era re- presented the physical world to themselves . To begin with , their most precious cultural resource , their poetry , required a vast knowledge of Arabian topography and place - names , from both poets and audiences . Beginning in the late 20s - early 30s / 630s , however , the great conquests and the ensuing exodus from Arabia had the effect of blurring , if not erasing this knowledge . The Arabic philologists of the Umayyad and early Abbasid eras accordingly compiled massive amounts of information about Arabian toponyms , and much of this later found its way into the geograph- ical literature ( Kramers 1954a , 84 ) . However , our fullest information in this area comes from the Qur'an . Here the earth is flat , with the sky raised over it as a \" guarded roof \" ( saqf mahfuz . 21:32 ) and the mountains serving to keep it stable ( 13 : 3 , 15:19 , 50 : 7 , 79:30 , etc. ) . God has also fashioned the sky into seven heavens ( samāwāt , 2:29 , 41:12 , etc. ) or roads or tracts ( tara'iq , 23:17 ) . On the whole , this Qur'anic cosmology accords with archaic Near Eastern mythology and tradition . In the following centuries , it received amplification in ḥadīth ( Prophetical Tradi- tion ) and in tafsir ( scriptural exegesis ) . However , it remained mostly separate from the literature described here as ' geographical , ' despite attempts at reconciling the two ( Ibn al - Faqih 1885 , 3 ; Muqaddasi 1877 , 10-19 ) .",

It appears that several Indians learned in astro- nomy , astrology and cosmography visited the court of Caliph al - Mansur ( r . 136-158 / 754-775 ) , known for his interest in astrology . As a result , we have some of the earliest translations ( or adap- tations ) of foreign works into Arabic ( Gutas 1998 [ CB ] , 24-5 ) . The Sanskrit word siddhanta , appearing in the titles of several astronomical works , entered Arabic as sindhind . Although the Ara- bic works in this tradition are now lost , Indian ideas retained a place in Islamicate geography and , afterward , in its Latin counterpart . These include the notion of a \" cupola of the earth , \" a summit or center of the known and inhabited hemisphere of the world , located at a place in central India equally distant from the northern , southern , eastern and western limits of this hemisphere .",

Ptolemy's Megale Syntaxis was translated early on into Arabic , as al - Majisti ( from which came its later Latin title , Almagest ) . In this astronomical work , Ptolemy had devoted a section to the division of the earth into \" climes \" ( \" inclinations , \" Greek klimata , sing . klima ) , which divided the northern hemisphere into zones by latitude . Arabic scholars now appropriated this term as iqlim , pl . aqālīm , and made it a vital element of their own under- standing of these matters . It is unclear , however , if the translators of the 3rd / 9th and 4th / 10th centuries ever produced an Arabic version of Ptolemy's work Geography , devoted entirely to this field of knowledge . Ibn Khurradädhbih ( d . 299 / 911-2 ) claimed to have translated it , and translations were attributed to later scholars . In the end , however , it seems that if an Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Geography did ever exist , it arrived later than the events about to be described here .",

An astrologer with broad interests , Khwārazmi here embarked on a project best described as Ptole- maic . Its Arabic title , which means , as indicated earlier , \" image , representation of the earth , \" is formed ( calqued ) after the Greek geographia , which means exactly the same thing . Both works consist of tables , and al - Khwārazmi has taken over large amounts of data from his predecessor . How did al - Khwārazmi get access to Ptolemy's Geography ? It is unlikely that he knew Greek himself , although perhaps someone could have translated for him on the spot . Since the Geogra- phy had been known previously to Syriac authors ( Krachkovskii 1957 , 20 ) , including Bardesanes ( d . c . 222 ) , an anonymous translator ( mid - 5th century ) , and Jacob of Edessa ( d . 89/708 ) , Syriac could quite plausibly have served as an intermediary ( Chapter 1.2 ) .

      "text": "Tables of longitude and latitude were of little practical use at that time , although scholars would continue to compile them for centuries to come . Quite a few modern researchers have maintained , however , that al - Khwarazmi's project included drawing a world map , meant to fit within the dimensions of his book . Another idea , often proposed though not universally accepted , is that al - Khwārazmi was contributing here toward a large - scale world map , using coordinates of latitude and longitude , for Caliph al - Ma'mun ( r . 189-218 / 813-833 ) . Such a project is indeed mentioned in some sources . In further support of this notion , it appears that Khwārazmi participated in the \" House of Wisdom \" ( bayt al - hikma ) in Baghdad , which many modern scholars have described as a research and / or teaching center supported by the caliphal court ( Chapter III.1 ) . However , problems arise . The Image of the Earth ( of which only one manuscript has survived ) does not mention any cartographical project , big or small . A few later sources do refer to a \" Ma'munian image [ or map ] \" ( sura ma'muniyya ) , but these accounts seem inaccurate or ill informed , especially that of al - Mas'udi ( [ d . 345/956 ] : 1894 , 33 ) , who appa- rently does not understand the Ptolemaic climes and who follows the Persian system of kishvars ( regions ) in his own work . Similarly , a bayt al - hikma may have existed in Baghdad as early as the reign of Caliph al - Mansur , but its nature and role are more obscure to us today than they were several decades ago ; in any case , it seems to have been more involved with Iranian learning than with Greek ( Balty - Guesdon 1992 ; Gutas 1998 , 53-60 [ CB ] ; Richter - Bernburg 2016 ) . Most significantly , difficulties arise regarding the process of mapmaking itself . Possibly because he did not have a complete translation of Ptolemy's Geography , al - Khwarazmi apparently did not con- sult the chapter on projections and therefore did not address the problem of how to represent the earth's spherical surface upon the flat surface of a map . All this makes it less likely that the Ma'munian world map was based on mathematical coordinates ; there is reason to think instead that it used the Persian system of kishvars . Looking ahead , we have a partial explanation here for why Islamicate cartography never dealt fully with the problem of projection ( Tibbetts 1992a , 94-5 ) , with the exception of al - Biruni ( 362 - d . after 444 / 973 - d . after 1053 ) and possibly a few other scholars before 700/1300 . Al - Khwarazmi's work in this area continued among later scholars including the astronomer al - Battānī ( 244-317 / 858-929 ) , who developed further tables for geographical coordinates , and the enigmatic Suhrab ( [ 1st half 4th / 10th century ] ; see Miquel 1967-88 , 1 : 79–80 ) , who did the same while providing explicit instructions for preparing a map . Most geographers considered the sphere of the earth as divided into two halves , only one of them known or even knowable . They divided the known half of the earth once more in half , with the northern part , or quadrant , constituting the inhabited world . They then further divided this northern quadrant with equally spaced latitudinal lines , reaching from the equator to the pole ; the area between each two of these constituted one of the seven climes . Work also continued on questions going back to the Hellenistic geographers , including how to calculate the distance of a single degree of latitude . Meanwhile , from the beginning of Islam , scholars faced the problem of determining the direction of Mecca ( the qibla ) from any point in the world ; their solutions , both approximate and accurate , constituted a great achievement for Islamicate geography over many centuries ( King 1999 [ CB ] ; King and Lorch 1992 [ CB ] ; Chapter VI.3 ) .",

The management of long - distance communications led to the creation ( or continuing ) of a postal and intelligence bureau ( diwan al - barīd ; Silverstein 2007 ) . Heading this for a time in the mid - 3rd / 9th century was Ibn Khurradadhbih , a professional bureaucrat of Persian descent , whose Routes and Realms ( al - Masalik wal - mamalik ) can be considered , along with al - Khwārazmi's Image of the Earth , as one of the foundations of Islamicate geography . Although Ibn Khurradadhbih includes smat- terings of Greek and Persian geography in his text , and even claims to have translated Ptolemy himself , he proceeds independently of astronomical and mathematical geography . Instead , and true to its title , Routes and Realms has a framework constituted by its wide - ranging itineraries . It indicates distances with stages ( what a traveler can cover in a day ) , and with units of measurement such as the Persian farsakh ( six kilometers ) and the mil or \" Arab mile \" ( somewhat longer than the English mile ) . It seems obvious - although it is never stated outright - that these itineraries result from compilations by the diwan al - barīd and its predecessors . At times Ibn Khurradadhbih adds landmarks for help in identifying place - names . He also gives fiscal information , less useful for travelers but much appreciated by later historians . At the same time , he cites poetry connected with particular places . He tells about wonders such as Sicilian volcanoes and the riches of Visi- gothic Spain , once seized by the Muslim conquerors . He also relays the purported accounts of travelers , such as the expedition of Sallam the Interpreter , sent by an Abbasid caliph to the land of Yajuj and Mājūj ( Gog and Magog ) in the ( otherwise legendary ) northeastern corner of the world . The overall result , while enjoyable for readers , lacks coherence , as some later geographers would point out . Meanwhile , Ibn Khurradādhbih makes no use whatsoever of maps . But he used schemes or diagrams , for instance for representing various qiblas ( King 1999 ) .",

For instance , it isolates the itineraries within a chapter of their own . Yet it rightly belongs within our sequence of geographical works for several reasons , beginning with its treatment of the frontiers . In Qudama's day , the unitary caliphate was fast becoming a fiction , as it lost control of its territories while successor states arose everywhere to supplant it . This fact underlies Qudama's chapter on the frontiers of Islam ( thughur al - Islam ) , where he coun- terintuitively portrays an Islamic world where unity prevails , not only in culture and religion but also , and above all , in political and administrative matters .

However , not only is this ' Balkhi school ' a concept of modern scholarship , but the relations among these authors , especially the first three , are enigmatic . Perceptive scholars such as al - Idrisi ( d . after 560 / 1164-5 ) and Yaqut al - Rumi ( d . 626/1229 ) showed perplexity over what these three took from one another and whether they were not really just one or two individuals . A solution came in 1871 , when M. J. de Goeje ( 1836-1906 ) showed that these were indeed three distinct authors ; that the geographical work of the first of them , Balkhi , was no longer extant ; and that the other two composed distinct , although related , books . Afterward , scholars went on to associate this ' Balkhi school ' with a collective project that they called ' the atlas of Islam ' ( Kramers 1932 ; Krachkovskii 1957 , 194-219 ; Miquel 1967-88 , 1 : 267-330 ; Miller 1986 1.1.17 , 5 : 109 ; Hopkins 1990 , 312-15 ; Tibbetts 1992b ) .",

This began with a map of the world and then presented twenty maps of provinces or \" climes \" with accompanying text . Balkhi's work was taken up afterward by al - Istakhri ( d . after 340/951 ) , who traveled extensively and composed a Book of Routes and Realms ( Kitab al - masalik wal - mamalik , ) , revising Balkhi's maps while adding new text . We know little else about the connection between these two , since Balkhi's maps and text became absorbed into Istakhri's or simply disappeared . Then in 331/943 , a young man known as Ibn Hawqal departed from Baghdad , intending to map and describe as many of the regions of the world as he could . Some time later , he met Istakhri ( Ibn Hawqal 1938 , 329-30 ) . The encounter is often said to have taken place in Sind , since Ibn Hawqal describes it in his chapter on that province , but this is incorrect , since Ibn Hawqal almost certainly never went there ( Miquel 1967-88 , 1 : 299–300 ) .",

In the wake of this apparent act of plagiarism we have , first of all , a book called Routes and Realms ascribed entirely to Işṭakhri , and then we have Ibn Hawqal's work which exists in two main recensions , the first called Routes and Realms , and the second Image of the Earth . In both recensions , Ibn Hawqal incorporates Işṭakhri's text while adding new material of his own .

They do share a need for autonomy , even privacy , in areas including their personal life , where they come across as solitary figures . In their religious life , Ibn Hawqal and perhaps Muqaddasi have Ismaili associations , which they mainly keep to themselves . For their professional activities , they conduct commerce , mostly on their own account . They show expertise in fiscal administration , commerce , agriculture , architecture , theology , law and just about everything else . What unites them above all is their critical acumen and power of observation . They articulate and follow research methods of remarkable sophistication ; among the earlier ( nonmathematical ) geographers , it is al - Ya'qūbi who most has this in common with them .",

      "text": "Finally , a defining and original characteristic of the ' Balkhi school ' is its use of maps . We do not know what models Balkhi himself used for these , but it seems that in his work the maps held pride of place while the text provided commentary . In Işṭakhri , however , the text can function without the maps . The same applies to Ibn Hawqal , while Muqaddasi's maps may even seem superfluous at times . In later centuries , however , the maps came to enjoy more popularity than the texts and acquired complex transmission histories of their own . Some modern scholars have maintained that these ' Balkhi school ' maps appeared in two distinctive varieties , the ' Iṣṭakhri ' and the ' Ibn Hawqal ' types . However , this division is difficult to trace , especially in its earlier stages , since the earliest complete ( or nearly complete ) set of ' Balkhi school ' maps that we have , accompanying an Ibn Hawqal manuscript , dates from around a century after the author's lifetime , while most extant examples date from considerably later than that . All the ' Balkhi school ' maps have distinctive features in common , including a lack of indications of latitude and longitude , and a predilection for simple geometrical shapes and straight lines . They show the inhabited world enclosed by the Encircling Sea ( al - baḥr al - mubit ) or Ocean , with two large inlets extending inland from this sea , forming the Sea of the Romans ( Mediterranean ) and the Sea of the Persians ( Indian Ocean , Arabian Sea , Persian Gulf , Red Sea ) . In the following centuries , these became shared features of most Islamicate world maps . Very recently , Karen Pinto ( 2016 ) has identified a symbolic vocabulary of meanings for these features and traits . She considers many historical sources for them and identifies Iranian , rather than Greco - Roman tradition , as their primary source . She also , less convincingly , deprives Balkhi and his ' school ' of the creative role usually attributed to them in cartographical tradition .",

Now , however , at least from our perspective , mathematical geography recovers the spotlight with al - Birūni , who spent much of his career in the service of the Ghaznavids , in the easternmost regions of the Islamicate world . Birūnī made a supreme contribution to ' human geography ' with his book on India ( Bīrūni 2000 ) . On the more strictly mathematical side , like his predecessor Ibn Yunus ( d . 399/1009 ) , Biruni combined geographical coordinates with tables of stellar coordinates . His Handbook for al - Mas'ud ( al - Qanun al - mas'udi ) provided the best tables of latitude and longitude available at the time , covering an unprece- dented total of 600 places . In doing this , Birūnī addressed the old problem of the measurement of a single degree of latitude ( Tibbetts 1992c , 141-2 ) . As is well known , he arrived at a remark- ably accurate figure for the circumference of the earth . He criticized the theory of projections that he attributed to Marinus of Tyre ( c . 70-130 ) and Ptolemy of Alexandria and proposed instead the method that we know now as the equidistant azimuthal projection . In this projection , all points on a map are at proportionally correct distances from the center point ; they are also at the correct direction ( or azimuth ) from the center point . This method was taken up afterward by Gerard Mercator ( 1512-1594 ) and other cartographers of the early modern era and remains prominent in contemporary mapmaking .",

Meanwhile , the broad category of geographical literature includes subgenres that we have not covered here , because of lack of space . These include the literature of travelers on land and sea that overlaps , notably , with the narratives of the ' Balkhi ' authors . Another subgenre is that of \" wonders of the world , \" which enjoyed popularity and became increasingly integrated into ' mainstream ' geography , especially in the Wonders of Creation ( ' Aja'ib al - makhluqāt ) of al - Qazwini ( d . 682/1283 ) . And finally , we have the encyclopedias of place - names , of which the greatest is the Dictionary of the Countries ( Mu'jam al - buldan ) of Yaqut al - Rūmi ( d . 626/1229 ) . This reader - friendly work presents thousands of place names in alphabetical order , providing ample literary , historical and indeed , geographical information . Today it remains an indispensable tool for students and scholars , enduring testimony to the fascination , utility and enjoyment that this geo- graphical literature brings .",
