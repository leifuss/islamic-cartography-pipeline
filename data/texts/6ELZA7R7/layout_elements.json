They provide information on the development of three of the four fundamental mathematical sciences - number theory , geometry , and astronomy , and their branches . They are also evidence of scholarly influences and transmission , mastery of craftsmanship , artistic and religious preferences , and the social acknowledgment of astronomy and astrology as well as the patronage and institutionalization of knowledge . This chapter deals with two of these instruments : celestial globes and armillary spheres . Celestial globes carry evidence of arts and craftsmanship in their time and region through the depictions of the constellations , the wording of the maker's signature , the names of stars , constellations , lunar mansions , and the nature of the scales included . Their popularity , as well as records of dedications , reveals non - scholarly interests and the patronage of different elite circles for globe making , while records of dates and places may provide information on the transition of knowledge between regions and centuries . In contrast , only a few examples of armillary spheres survive , preventing us from making a broad assessment of the instrument's role in society . However , extant manuals on its construction and use shed some light on the devel- opment of the instrument .",

A careful investigation of the extant instruments , however , gives us credible information on two types of metal spheres used as globes .

The equator carries a scale of 360 ° , while the ecliptic has twelve scales of 30 ° . Both begin at the vernal equinox and are divided into intervals of 5º , 6º , or 10 ° , where the divisions are labeled with Arabic alphanumeric notation ( abjad ) and subdivided into intervals of 1 ° or 2 ° . The twelve scales of the ecliptic are inscribed with the corresponding names of the signs of the zodiac . The poles of the equator and the ecliptic are usually marked with circles and occasionally labeled . The globe is divided into twelve sec- tions by six great circles drawn at intervals of 30 ° between the ecliptic poles . One of these is a solstitial colure , which is a great circle through the celestial poles , the poles of the ecliptic , and the summer and winter solstices . None of the standard globes carries circles of ever - visible or ever - invisible stars . Depending on the type of globe , stars and the constellation figures may or may not be inscribed .

In the eighth book of the Almagest , Ptolemy describes a globe with a rotatable ecliptic ring ( Ptolemy 1998 [ CB ] , 2² 404-7 ) . The purpose of this modification is to allow for the deviation caused by the precession of the equinoxes over the years ( approximately 1 ° in 72.2 years in modern value ) . Al - Battani introduced a globe called an egg ( bayda ) , which was a common term for globes , with five rings ( al - Battāni 1977 [ CB ] , 210-13 [ fols 142a - 44b ] ) . The celestial equator and the ecliptic are drawn on the globe as usual . Additionally , there are two meridian rings , one is fixed and the other rotates , a horizon ring , a zenith ring , and the outer ring , which carries a movable and removable gnomon . Unlike the other examples , al - Battani's egg does not sit on a stand but is suspended . The second rotatable meridian ring serves for marking the star positions and making calculations accurately . The movable gnomon is used to mark the solar longitude and the altitude of the sun along with many other applications . Unfortunately , no example of these two ingenious devices has survived .",

Construction manuals for astrolabes and sundials , however , are much more common . They usually give precise values in ratios as pointers for engravings such as almucantars , azimuths , and seasonal hours on astrolabes and parabolas and hyperbolas of shadow lengths of various signs of the zodiac on sundials . On the other hand , globes require their users to consider only two parameters : ( 1 ) the obliquity of the ecliptic and ( 2 ) the precession of the equinoxes . While the value of the obliquity was calculated and given differently by various astronomers , the globe makers seem to have used approximate values such as 23.5 ° or 24 ° . Considering the small size of the instrument one should not expect a precision of more than half or a quarter of a degree . The value of the precession is more impor- tant since the makers usually used older catalogues for star positions ( i.e. , al - Şüfi's Book of the Constellations ) and needed to consider the positional changes of stars during the period between the preparation of the star catalogue and the construction of the globe .",

According to al - Battānī , the maker needs to determine two points that are exactly opposite of each other on the globe , which will act as the celestial poles . However , he doesn't mention how this is done . Al - Battani's summary of the different steps for construction reflects the scholar's effort for providing globe makers ( craftsmen as well as scholars ) with the necessary skills . Using the poles , the globe maker is told to draw a great circle as the celestial equator and then to mark four equidistant points on it . The steady leg of a pair of compasses has to be fixed at one of these points , and the drawing leg is used to draw another great circle that passes through two points on the equator and the poles , making it the solstitial colure . In order to determine the positions of the ecliptic poles and to draw the ecliptic , the globe maker has to inscribe a quarter of the equator with a scale of 90 ° . Learning from al - Battani's text that the obliquity of the ecliptic is 23 ° 35 ' , the globe maker , using the scale , can now open the legs of the compasses as wide as the value of the obliquity . Then he fixes the steady leg at one of the celestial poles and rotates the drawing leg until it intersects with the solstitial colure . Wherever the tip of the leg touches on the colure he marks as an ecliptic pole . The same procedure is carried out for the second pole . Once the poles are marked , he can draw the ecliptic .",

Keeping the width fixed , the globe maker has now to place the steady leg on the corresponding degree of the zodiacal sign as its longitude . He is instructed to use the drawing leg to draw a small , concave arc for an approximate position . Depending on the direction of the star , he draws the arc either on the north or the south of the ecliptic but always eastward . To make the position more precise , he has to open the compasses exactly 90 ° and to place the steady leg on a point that is 90 ° west of the longitude of the star on the ecliptic circle . Now he can draw a second arc by using the drawing leg . The intersection of the two arcs gives the position of the star . All designations are approximate since the scales have only 1 ° intervals .",

In the fifth chapter of the second book , he gives details on how to construct celestial globes and armillary spheres ( MS Oxford , Bodleian Library , Marsh 154 , fols 2b - 5a ) . In the section on the globe , he first describes finding the diameter of a globe and proposes to make a quadrant with a scale of 90 ° and the same radius as the globe . He then introduces a method for precision drawing . According to this , one picks any point on the globe as the center , then places the steady leg of the compass on this center and draws a small circle with four equidistant points marked on it . After this , the quadrant , that was introduced while finding the diameter of the globe , is required . The quadrant is placed on the globe so that its rim touches any one of the four equidistant points while one of its ends remains fixed at the original center . Starting from the center , an arc is drawn along the rim of the quadrant . The other end of the arc marks one of the poles . Then the quadrant is rotated until its rim touches the opposite one of the equidistant points . A secondary arc is drawn to mark the second pole . After this , al - Marrākushi proposes that one should use a lathe to engrave the celestial equator . To do that , the globe should be held axially in the lathe so that it can be rotated about its poles . Then , using a point equidistant from each pole as the reference , one can engrave a great circle that also passes through the center and the two remaining points of the small circle .",

Although none of the extant globes resembles fully the types introduced by al - Battani or al - Marrākushi , determining whether the producers of the extant globes had indeed used any of their methods for drawing the circles and marking the star positions requires further research . ' Abd al - Rahman al - Şüfi was perhaps the scholar whose work had the greatest impact on the construction of globes . In his famous work , Book of the Star Constellations , he illustrates 48 constellations and marks 1025 stars from Ptolemy's star catalogue . He also offers the ecliptic coordinates ( longitude and latitude ) and the brightness of the stars in tables and gives detailed descriptions of the positions of the stars relative to their constellations . Each constellation is depicted as it is seen in the sky and on the globe . Al - Sufi's catalogue relies heavily on Ptolemy's values , but he adds 12 ° 42 ' to the longitude of each star to eliminate the difference caused by the precession of the equinoxes and occasionally changes some of the values to the ones he obtained through his own observations ( Dekker 2012 , 29-47 ) . Al - Şüfi's catalogue and , more importantly , his illustrations were helpful for preparing star catalogues and constructing globes . It was used until the 13th / 19th century .",

Depending on the globe's type , the number of applications that can be performed with it differs . Moreover , the celestial globes , with the exception of those using an additional gnomon and a detached quadrant , are not destined for observations but for calcula- tions and demonstrations .

The number of dated globes rises exponentially in the 11th / 14th century and the provenances shifted from the Middle East to Mughal India . The dates and signatures on the instruments provide proof of the continuous activity of families and individual specialists as instrument - making artisans . In comparison to other instruments such as astrolabes , quadrants , and sundials , relatively more non - scholarly artisans seem to be involved in the construction of globes . There were two noteworthy cities for instrument makers : Har- ran ( today in Turkey ) and Lahore ( today in Pakistan ) . Although little of their production has survived , the historical record indicates that Harran was a major center for the construction of astronomical instruments between the 3rd / 9th and the 5th / 11th centuries . ' Abd al - Rahman al - Şüfi states , for instance , that he has seen many globes made in Harran and that he disapproved of a globe made by Ali ibn Isa from Harran ( MS Paris , BnF , Arabe 5036 , fols 4b , 108b ) .

Although al - Fazari categorized the armillary sphere as a type of astrolabe , this was not followed by others , and it was usually treated as a different instrument . The armillary sphere became popular very early in the history of astronomy in the Islamicate world through the translations of Ptolemy's Almagest in the 2nd / 8th and 3rd / 9th centuries . In the fifth book of the Almagest , Ptolemy introduces an armillary sphere with six rings , as follows ( Ptolemy 1998 , 217-18 ) :",

Both were made by Khalid ibn ' Abd al - Malik al - Marwarrūdhi ( 3rd / 9th century ) , an instrument maker of the Abbasid Caliph al - Ma'mun ( r . 198-218 / 813-833 ; Sayili 1960 [ 1988 ] [ CB ] , 57 ) . No further information about these instruments seems to have survived . Several centuries later , two firsthand records were written on armillary spheres used in the two most important observatories in the Islamicate world : Maragha and Samarqand . Al - ' Urḍi , Maragha's instrument maker , compiled The Epistle on How ( to Make ) Observations ( al - Risala fi kay- fiyyat al - arṣād ) . In it , he deals with several instruments , some of which were his own inventions . He also wrote a comprehensive section on the construction of a wooden armillary sphere with five rings and a diameter of approximately 160cm ( MS Istanbul , Süleymaniye Library , Nuruos- maniye 2971 , fols 76b - 82a ) . Al - ' Urdi gives measurements for the diameter , width , and thickness of each ring and detailed instructions on how to attach the rings , as well as how to preserve the instrument's condition . He shows why Ptolemy's ' observation ' ring is inconvenient and argues that an alidade is a better option for observations . In another text , Giyath al - Din al - Jamshid al - Kashi ( d . 832/1429 ) , who was the first director of the observatory in Samarqand , mentions an armillary sphere with seven rings that were employed in the observations ( Kennedy 1961 , 100 ) . It should be noted that both texts are derivations from Ptolemy's descriptions in the Almagest .",

They are universal in nature ; they can be used anywhere in the world .

Both instruments provide ample evidence for scholarly activities , astronomical interests in the corresponding communities , and the transmission of astronomical knowledge through time . The many unique surviving instruments and the manuals on their construction and use deserve thorough investigation . Most of the dated and authored globes were produced for the courtly elites such as Ayyubids , Safavids , or Mughals .
