They include preserved maps of Ibn Haukal , Al - Masudi and Al - Idrisi . Al - Masudi ( 871-956 / 7 ) made a map of the world and wrote that the Earth is round , before the Christians in Europe were ready to accept that idea . The famous geographer and cartographer Al - Idrisi ( IX / X . , died in 903/913 . ) has lived on the court of Norman king Roger II of Sicily , and after his death on the court of his son William I on Sicily , where he obtained the data from European and Arabic geographers . On the basis of this data he wrote a work known entitled Roger's book . Besides this important work he made a celestial globe and a map of the world in the shape of a silver disk . The lines that marked the borders of seven regions of the inhabited world were engraved on this disk . The Arabs had excellent knowledge of Greek astronomy and accepted their division of the world in seven climatic zones .",

By request of Al - Istakhri , he has edited his geo- graphical maps , enlargened the text , and published it under his name in 976/7 under the title Al - Masâlik w'al - Mamâlik ( Roads and kingdoms ) , known also under the ti- tle Kitāb Surat al - ard ( The Book about description of the Earth ) .3 Ibn Haukal was the best representative of geographers that wrote on the basis of their own trips and direct observations . His descriptions were precise and very useful for travelers . The map Surat al - Ardh ( Picture of the Earth ) , includes detailed description of Muslim Spain , Italy , Byzantine Empire ( fig . 2 ) . With this map he gave a description of Kiev , mentioned the road of Volga Bulgars and Khazars.5 The main difference between the work of Ibn Haukal and Al - Istakhri is that he describes Islamic lands of West Europe and North Africa . The authors did not copy maps , but they made them indepen- dently . Ibn Haukal , in contrast to his predecessor , has added a description of a map in the chapter about each region . Besides Ibn Haukal's work published by M. J. De Goeje in 1873. , we know of one more abridged edition of an anonymous author from 1233 .",
