The first [principle] is that by which one recognizes that the objects, which can be seen in mirrors, appear in con- formity with the direction of the visual ray, which falls upon the objects by means of its own reflection. This [reflection] is verified in conformity with the position of the pupil with respect to the mirror. The second [principle], without a doubt, is that by which one recognizes that the single [points] that one sees in the mirrors appear on the perpendicular line that falls from the object that is seen onto the surface of the mir ror and penetrates it. The third [principle], instead, is that by which one recognizes that the position of the bent ray, which is found between the pupil and the mirror and between the mirror and the thing that is to be seen, is such that each of these two [segments] arrives at the point in respect to which the break occurs, while they contain, parting from the mirror, angles equal with the perpendicular line that exits from the very same point.”",

This is the point “in conformity to which the apparition of the object occurs” (a quo fit apparitio rei). But Ptolemy specifies again that this point must be unus in numero et situ, that is to say “one only in quantity and in position.” The sign must be one only “in quantity” because the eyes, as we have seen, even though they are two and both appear in the mirror, create just one single reflection of the image; it must be one only “in position” because that point must be placed upon the mirror where the perpendicular from",

He projects the sphere onto a vertical plane, passing through the center of the earth, from a point in space taken from the paral- lel plane of Syene (Figs. 102, 103). The area he delimits covers the oikoumene of the ancients, the world as then known. In producing such a boundary, Ptolemy designed the elliptical projections of the equatorial circle below and of the parallel circle above, the latter passing through Thule. This is a classi cal scenographic or perspectival projection.",
